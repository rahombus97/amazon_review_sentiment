                "review_text": "I am a die hard Apple person. All my desktop computers at home are Apple, my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple. Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far. I was using a 4 1/2 year old iPhone 5s so I figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. It still takes a little getting used to coming from the IOS system's way of doing things. I do lose the capability of iMessage and FaceTime. Not a huge deal and I can use the DUO app from Google which is the same as FaceTime. The key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. I like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). I think the new iPhone X does this too but again, I'm coming from a 5s. My only two choices for a new phone were this S9+ or keep on with Apple and get an iPhone X. The X would have cost me $1150 plus an AppleCare warranty for $200. I got this Samsung (and got the Ultimate Play Bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. Took out a Square Trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should I need to use it. I have used Square Trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. Square Trade is owned by Allstate so I have confidence in them. Getting back to the phone, the S9+ seems to work VERY fast when loading apps and pages. I use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (Nest thermostat, wireless cameras, LIFX lights, Liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. The audio when playing music sounds great. Plays very loud and clear for a phone. I like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. I like the Android system as it comes with Google Assistant voice command. Most people hate the Bixby feature on this phone. My only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume I accidentally hit Bixby sometimes. I do like though that i's voice activated. I get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up Bixby and command it to open up whatever app I need (usually Waze). Once open, I speak to Waze to take me to work. All of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. Also, the Bixby AI camera function is very cool too. There are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. Like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to English or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). Point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. Point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). The ONLY thing I think I will never use again and of course I tried it out is the Animoji of myself or any of my friends. It's scary weird. Everyone looks the same on this. I would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3D type and look more realistic. I have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. Mot notably the iPhone X. In my opinion, the X does do a lot of pix better. The contrast is usually better. The real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. So, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iPhone X. The only thing I had to get used to is the colors on a Samsung phone are very oversaturated. Colors are very bright. There is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. I turned it down to one of them and it now looks a LOT more realistic. I like the fact that this phone, as well as the iPhone X, features ability to record video at 4K 60fps. Looks great. On the Samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4K 60fps. Keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. For all other video formats, the stabilization on the Samsung works better than the X. All in all, I am happy I went with the Samsung. In a few months if I regret it, I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus. UPDATE: 4/7/2018. The voice unlock code is terrible. And, after searching through the options on the phone I came to the conclusion I don't need it. I have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. I actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. Battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. One thing I find annoying that I didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. Whether I send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. This is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. I was used to having an iPhone and using iMessage. Send any size video to someone else with an iPhone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. Not so with Android. Now this is not just Samsung but all Android phones. So, for now, I have to send videos via WhatsApp or Viber (or a number of other text apps). They do compress but not horribly. Oh, and one more note. I hope Samsung corp is reading this review. The Samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people I have ever dealt with for a tech company. I used to think Comcast was bad until I called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at Samsung. They just repeat my question and tell me they understand how I feel offering absolutely no answers. They put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. Just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at AppleCare when I had a question about my iPhone or iMac computer. 2nd UPDATE: I didn't realize this and this is VERY important to know before purchasing. In fact, I'm on the AT&T network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. The sales people in Best Buy in the phone department did not know this either. When you buy an unlocked Galaxy S9 or S9+, your phone is $840. If however you want to buy it thru AT&T for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. Meaning, the unlocked phone WILL NOT have: WIFI calling option, HD Audio option, VVM (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. The option for these features is not even on my phone. Now, you CAN buy the AT&T phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). After you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the AT&T phone unlocked and then you will have these features. Nowhere at Best Buy or any AT&T store do they tell you this. In my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. I picked up the bundle package here on Amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so I'm keeping my setup. I just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. I figured the AT&T version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. Hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. And, I went to the AT&T store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. There isn't. They cannot update your phone to get these options. 3rd UPDATE: April 15th, 2018 I discovered a great feature today. I wish these Galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iPhone X has. You pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. What I discovered is setting the Google Assistant to open the Galaxy EVEN FROM the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the Google Assistant to do. Love this feature immensely.",

                "review_text": "My husband bought me this phone in the lilac purple color for my birthday,...it's gorgeous! I love the display and the infinity edge. For me this is a total upgrade from the S5 I've been using, I'm so glad I waited! Everything shows up bright and crystal clear. Even my email looks nicer! The emojis you make using the camera do turn out a bit creepy,...they look like you but not really. At my age I don't think this is something I see myself using too often in chat or messenger. It's fun for all of maybe 10 minutes. The camera is nice, the pictures come out clean and clear. However I do wish all the features were explained a bit more in the manual to make it easier to figure out. It's nice being able to scroll through the different modes with a swipe of your finger but the how-to's on using some of the different options would be nice if they were printed out in the manual for reference. I'm sure it would be easy enough to look on YouTube or Google,....Haha I suppose this is what happens when you go from an old phone and leap frog over a few generations and find yourself in the future. :p I'm not too crazy about Bixby though, there should be a way to reassign the button to something else and remove the app entirely if you choose. I also like my camera settings set so you say \"Smile\", \"Shoot,\" \"Cheese\", \"Record video\", or another trigger word,... but unless you completely turn off the voice for Bixby you can't use the voice command on the camera. One feature should not cancel out another,... maybe there will be a software update later on. Or maybe I have completely missed the setting somewhere and will bump into it somewhere after I've used it more? The speakers are excellent, music sounds great and phone calls come through very clear. Using speaker phone I actually had to turn call volume down, on my old phone it was hard to hear people talk and the mic didn't pick up very well either. Not the case here! I love this phone! It's a nice size, easy to hold, and looks great! It was also very easy to set up and after I played with it for awhile I found it simple to navigate with a few cool surprises thrown in for me to discover. Having read how similar this phone is to the S8 I can understand some people being annoyed at spending all their money and not really getting much more than they already had, but I did read before these were released that they were similar and if I had an S8 I probably would not have bought this model. For the most part I still feel this is a great phone. I know for a fact I will have a great time taking pictures and videos of my kids and grandkids with it! *3/21/18- Added a few sample pictures, one is a close up (approx.12\" away, begging dog wanted my lunch), another a couple inches away, and the others from about 15 feet. No filters just had the camera set to auto and let it do its thing. Pictures come out clear and so much nicer than from my other phone. I've been playing with the other features as well and results are great too. Using the volume button to snap a quick picture is convenient, it makes taking pictures with this size phone so much easier. I'll have a great time using this camera when the grand kids visit! The lock screen is a little annoying when you have to click the power button then do the swipe screen, but in a way it's useful, my old phone did all sorts of things on its own while tumbling around in my bag. The hidden home button and the power button are both quick and responsive, either one quickly wakes the phone up but the home button brings up the home screen if you press it when the screen is off. You can always change the time out settings so your screen doesn't click off as fast to give you more time, so not really a big deal for me. This is a fun phone to have. Battery life for me is great, I keep the display on bright because it's just so pretty. I also have the time out screen set for 5 minutes. I just charge my phone once a day and I'm good to go! No regrets with this phone. I'll update as I go along, good or bad.",

I see some people are unhappy that carrier visual voicemail is unavailable from the play store for this unlocked phone (and the s8) but it IS possible to get it working.

                "review_text": "My husband bought me this phone in the lilac purple color for my birthday,...it's gorgeous! I love the display and the infinity edge. For me this is a total upgrade from the S5 I've been using, I'm so glad I waited! Everything shows up bright and crystal clear. Even my email looks nicer! The emojis you make using the camera do turn out a bit creepy,...they look like you but not really. At my age I don't think this is something I see myself using too often in chat or messenger. It's fun for all of maybe 10 minutes. The camera is nice, the pictures come out clean and clear. However I do wish all the features were explained a bit more in the manual to make it easier to figure out. It's nice being able to scroll through the different modes with a swipe of your finger but the how-to's on using some of the different options would be nice if they were printed out in the manual for reference. I'm sure it would be easy enough to look on YouTube or Google,....Haha I suppose this is what happens when you go from an old phone and leap frog over a few generations and find yourself in the future. :p I'm not too crazy about Bixby though, there should be a way to reassign the button to something else and remove the app entirely if you choose. I also like my camera settings set so you say \"Smile\", \"Shoot,\" \"Cheese\", \"Record video\", or another trigger word,... but unless you completely turn off the voice for Bixby you can't use the voice command on the camera. One feature should not cancel out another,... maybe there will be a software update later on. Or maybe I have completely missed the setting somewhere and will bump into it somewhere after I've used it more? The speakers are excellent, music sounds great and phone calls come through very clear. Using speaker phone I actually had to turn call volume down, on my old phone it was hard to hear people talk and the mic didn't pick up very well either. Not the case here! I love this phone! It's a nice size, easy to hold, and looks great! It was also very easy to set up and after I played with it for awhile I found it simple to navigate with a few cool surprises thrown in for me to discover. Having read how similar this phone is to the S8 I can understand some people being annoyed at spending all their money and not really getting much more than they already had, but I did read before these were released that they were similar and if I had an S8 I probably would not have bought this model. For the most part I still feel this is a great phone. I know for a fact I will have a great time taking pictures and videos of my kids and grandkids with it! *3/21/18- Added a few sample pictures, one is a close up (approx.12\" away, begging dog wanted my lunch), another a couple inches away, and the others from about 15 feet. No filters just had the camera set to auto and let it do its thing. Pictures come out clear and so much nicer than from my other phone. I've been playing with the other features as well and results are great too. Using the volume button to snap a quick picture is convenient, it makes taking pictures with this size phone so much easier. I'll have a great time using this camera when the grand kids visit! The lock screen is a little annoying when you have to click the power button then do the swipe screen, but in a way it's useful, my old phone did all sorts of things on its own while tumbling around in my bag. The hidden home button and the power button are both quick and responsive, either one quickly wakes the phone up but the home button brings up the home screen if you press it when the screen is off. You can always change the time out settings so your screen doesn't click off as fast to give you more time, so not really a big deal for me. This is a fun phone to have. Battery life for me is great, I keep the display on bright because it's just so pretty. I also have the time out screen set for 5 minutes. I just charge my phone once a day and I'm good to go! No regrets with this phone. I'll update as I go along, good or bad.",

I'm still getting used to the new operating system and layout. I've been used to the Galaxy's home button, and the back and multi-screen buttons, so it's interesting adapting to a completely smooth device. Where the apps icon was on the home screen, is now the camera icon. If you're upgrading like I did, you have to flick upwards to get to the apps. But this is not, in any way, a downside. The speakers are great, and listening to music through earphones is awesome. I absolutely love this new phone! I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new phone!",

THE GOOD: Samsung still has excellent built quality and clever features that make their devices unique. I especially fell in love with the DeX feature. Being able to turn your phone into a fully functioning desktop computer is just cool and amazing. I first got introduced to this kind of feature on a Huawei Mate 10 Pro (which I also had to return for other reasons). Once I actually got exposed to the DeX, I knew I wanted it in my life. Samsung's displays are just amazing and unrivaled! I doubt I have to say more. :) The camera was ok. For some reason, it didn't live up to the hype; at least not in my opinion. Compared to my Pixel 2 XL pictures, the ones taken with the Samsung were way too bright, sometimes over exposed, looked rather soft and lacked depth / details. In this days and age, that's nitpicking, I know. All top tier phones take great pictures. It doesn't matter which phone you get, every single one of them will take great pictures while letting you down in one or another department. THE \"DOESN'T MATTER MUCH BUT STILL ANNOYING\": Samsung's launcher (user interface) has improved a lot. I still don't really care for it but I could at least have lived with it. I hate how all the settings have been moved around and how you have to search for them in spots where you would never have expected them. For instance WiFi Calling. Why is that in the settings of the phone app rather than under Network and Connectivity? Pre-installed apps are just as annoying today as they were a few years back. Granted, this days, it isn't as much as it used to be but why not making them uninstallable rather than baking them into the OS? I know I can disable an app, however, I would prefer if it isn't there in the first place! Samsung's need to duplicate virtually all and any of Google's services is, in my opinion, a waste of resources and it doesn't make their platform more attractive. Why do I need a Samsung Clock app that doesn't do any more than the default Android Clock app? Why do I need a Samsung Phone app where the default Android Phone app is just fine? Same goes for Samsung Mail, Samsung Calendar and a bunch more. If I could at least remove them and replace them with the stock Android apps, I would be more inclined to buy a Samsung phone. Bixby is a whole other story! From the get-go, I had no intention of using Samsung's assistant. Yet, here she was, right in my face. I could deactivate her on the home screen, however, there was no way of deactivating the assistant entirely. I remembered that the Bixby button (which I hit multiple times already by accident) could be deactivated. Yeah, sure! You first have to create a Samsung account, then configure Bixby just to be able to finally click on a settings icon in Bixby and deactivate the hardware button. I don't know who thought of this nonsense! As mentioned, I would have been able to live with the above. Annoying (to me), yes, but I could live with it. THE BAD: The most important thing on the phone simply doesn't work right: network reception! I got 1 to 0 bars of mobile reception where every other phone in the house got at least 3. I constantly lost network. Researching this problem online, I learnt that this has been an issue with all of Samsung's high end devices since the Oreo update. The forums across the globe are filled with user complaints. The German Samsung forum, for example, has 59 pages of users complaining about network reception issues on the S8, S8+, Note 8, S9 and S9+. This has been going on since February, it seems. Users state that their phones were fine with Android 7.x but since the Oreo update, everything is a mess. Strangely, this also affects WiFi calling, too. I wasn't able to place a single call without either fading out conversations or mute calls. There are a gazillion sites out there claiming to have the fix for this issues but none of them actually work. Samsung has yet to acknowledge the problem. Instead, they blame your network provider and make you hard reset your device. If that doesn't help, they will offer you to exchange your brand new device with a refurbished one under warranty - at least that's what they offered me! In between, Samsung issued an update to improve network stability but, looking around in the web, that didn't seem to have solved the problem. Regardless, a phone that can't even do the basic task of being a phone is useless to me, so, I returned mine.",

The display is pretty awesome, nice colors, and the storage capacity is great, as well as the added benefit of adding an sd card for extra memory.

I was using an iPhone 5c which was incredibly slow thanks to apple purposefully making it damn near impossible to use after the last and final update they sent me about a year ago. I'll break down what I like and do not like about this phone though: Pros - slim, shiny, beautiful screen, fast response times from everything to opening the phone to the apps I use as well as the internet. If has built in facial and iris recognition and allows you have the alternative option of putting a code or password into the phone to open it. (Honestly I highly recommend choosing a backup option to unlock the phone because although the facial and iris recognition is great, it's not flawless especially if you're wearing a costume, heavy makeup, etc.) The sound is great and the quality of the photos is amazing compared to what I had before. Cons: the phone is much heavier than what I am used to or what I had expected. The camera, although great when you're far away, has absolutely awful quality (much worse than my old iPhone) when you zoom in. The price for the phone was about average. I found this to be a better deal than the Google XL 2, or the iPhone X which in my opinion were both overpriced, however I still think 760 with taxes is a little much for a phone, especially one that didn't introduce anything new to the market that wasn't already out there and available with other products and companies. Lastly, if you are an iOS user and are considering switching to android like I did, heed my warning, because I can't put this in larger letters if I tried: DO NOT FORGET TO DEACTIVATE YOUR IMESSAGES. if you do not deactivate them, you will NOT be able to receive imessages (texts) from ANY iPhone or iPad user. I ran into a huge issue with this and even though I was incredibly careful, I STILL had to visit the apple webpage to manually deactivate my apple account in order to fix the issue. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase. P.S.: note that if you are changing from iOS to android, you may also run into a problem transferring apps and logging back into any cross phone / platform games that you were playing. I had to find work around and contact account recovery due to apple using game center vs. Android using Google and Facebook. I highly suggest you link any games you can't live without to Facebook or gmail prior to switching devices or you will find yourself switching back and forth between devices several times to resolve the issue.",

I've been using Google phones for a number of years so I was concerned about Samsung wrecking the UI. But after disabling Bixby and its button, it's pretty much back to working like vanilla Android as far as I'm concerned. I like the \"infinity screen\" for the fact that it increases screen size without greatly increasing the size of the phone. My 5X is only a bit smaller than the S9+! My biggest complaint, and the reason I'm giving 4/5 stars is for the exterior feel of this phone - it's very very slippery! The 5X has a rubberized coating that makes it easy to pick up and hold and also not slide off of surfaces, I greatly miss that. For example when I navigate while driving I put the phone on my right knee. This new phone immediately slides right off. I'm definitely going to get some kind of case or grippy skin for it. I am using this phone on a Red Pocket plan with Verizon service.",

This is the best of the bunch, for certain, and there is little or no learning curve going from one to the other. They took a really good smartphone (S8), and just made it better in many ways (and, in my opinion, worse in a couple, but more on that later). Dimensions - it's extremely similar to the S8, the only noticeable difference is the overall length is a touch shorter - compensated for by having less black margin around the screen edges.Visually, the screen is fantastic. The touch responsiveness is fantastic, and the performance is snappy. The fingerprint scanner is in a far better position than on the S8. Things I don't like as much - the iris scanning/facial recognition. I preferred the system in the S8 for sure. The avatars of yourself you can make from a selfie are, well, just downright creepy.",

The iphone x was blurry and the print wasn't legible. This phone has an incredible aperture to take crisp pictures even in low light.

Overall this phone probably has one of the best cameras on the market. The specs are good, you'll be able to multitask without any issues.

In addition to the step price and ear buds priced separately, I am much more of a fan of Amazon apps / products and my feeling was these would adapt better to Android products. I am so thrilled I took the leap to make this change - and here is a list why: 1. Super high quality phone - with simple set up. 2. AMAZING camera with loads of different features. 3. Dual sim - so enjoy BOTH work and personal number on the same device. 4. DUAL WHATSAPP!!! 5. Seamless integration for all Amazon apps (photos, shopping, music, Kindle, and Audible). Same was not true ot iPhone products. 6. I have been duped by Apple to some degree - H have invested thousands in TV and movies through iTunes - hoping that one day they make these available on other devices, but happy that purchases through Google or Amazon will be should I move back to Apple in the future. 7. Can't beat the price - was able to trade in an old phone and saved $200!! It is hard to say what the future holds but I am quite happy to be back with Samsung for now!!",

                "review_text": "Literally the best phone I've ever had, I loved it so much I decided to upgrade to the S9 Plus version. Here's my layman's review on both. PROs: - The night photos are where this phone shines, definitely able to get every detail possible in low lighting. - Battery life is massive with both phone: S9 has a 3000mAh / S9 Plus 3500mAh - Plenty of RAM: S9 has 4gigs/ S9 Plus 6gigs. Both perform very extremely well but 6 gigs worth of RAM seems like overkill as 4 gigs from the S9 suffice with little to no slowdowns. - Headphone jack on both version. Also comes with some sweet AKG earbuds. - AR emoji is relatively fun and great to show to people interested in checking out the phone - Thin phone - 4k Video quality - Great Speakers - Samsung Pay, literally can be used anywhere that accepts Cards as it mimics the magnetic strip (Not like Google Pay that relies on the ereader). - Live Translations with Bixby Vision - (Plus Version) Live photo mode. Really great feature, and editable - (Plus version) 2 Rear Cameras with optical zoom at 2x and digital at 10x, and dual capture CONs: - While night photos are amazing, daytime photos can sometimes appear overly saturated. - There isn't a noticeable size difference between both phones. - What is the point of Bixby? Really difficult to incorporate it into my daily life without actively thinking \"I should give Bixby a try\" - While thin, it's somewhat heavy. - Besides the camera, there isn't a massive difference between S9 and S9 Plus. VERDICT: As stated above, I love the S9 so much I upgraded to the Plus version. Both phones run extremely fast with little to no slowdown, even having several apps open does little to bog it's performance down. Photos look fantastic at especially at night with both versions. My only issue is the new Bixby button: it's not something I would actively use but at least users can disable this feature. Overall it's a lovely phone, S9 works just as well as the S9 Plus but lacking a few features with the camera.",

The slide down feature on the lock screen has many options, but no clock or calculator like the iPhone does (without add-on modifying). The standard ring tones are very limited and not desirable. Even though the music plays loud, the ringtones do not. Even though it has a press button lock, then swipe, it still seems to unlock in my pocket. But the iPhone did too.

I even went all in with the BOGO deal from Verizon and upgraded Junior at the same time. Rarely have I been so disappointed in a tech purchase! And Samsung, I hope you have people watching for this sort of post. I'll be RETURNING. THIS. PHONE. tomorrow. Major shortcomings include \"Bixby,\" microphone placement, and voice recognition. First, the \"Bixby\" personal assistant is a train wreck. I don't know who decided that an unholy union of the Yahoo! home page and Google Assistant was a good idea, but they seriously missed the mark. And it CAN'T. BE. DISABLED. Nothing enrages me more than software bundles that can't be disabled. Second, you have to hold the phone in your hand to be able to talk on the speakerphone, or the microphone is muffled and useless. Seriously, Samsung?! the whole point of the speakerphone function is to be able to put the phone down. Thirdly--and this is the deal killer for me--the voice recognition for talk-to-text, voice dialing, and talk-to-email is just abysmal. These features worked nearly flawlessly on my S7, but on the S9+ I'm flying into daily rages over the garbled nonsense the phone \"hears\" when I talk to it. I have no accent and enunciate very clearly and it does no good. Even if I shout single words and go completely over the top on my enunciation, I can't send a single text message of the simplest imaginable words. I spend 50-60 hours per week driving and MUST be able to communicate hands free as much as technologically possible. Swing and a resounding miss, Samsung.",

The operating system is way way more polished and the camera is superior to my Panasonic Lumix. My wife's Galaxy S8 seems just about the same but the 9 is noticeably zippier but I have way fewer apps. In our household we have Macs, PC's, iPads, Roku's, Tablets so we aren't married to any particular brand. For the phones I've enjoyed Samsungs. My wife got a deal on an LG and it was a big headache as it had hardware failures. Important, currently, as of this writing the S9 has a software problem where notifications on the apps DOES NOT work. Since I've come to rely on those little numbers on the top left corner of my apps this is an inconvenience. My old Samsung came with SVoice which I prefer over Bixby for simplicity but it's slowly winning me over. Ask Bixby to Rap for you, it's hilarious.",

It arrives bloated and you can do nothing about it. Also, in typical Android fashion, you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on. Every app you install makes the phone that much slower. This is an Android problem, same thing happens on the Pixel 2 XL. I should have stuck with the Pixel which is uglier, but not full of bloat. It has a nice screen though, but I like the iPhone\u2019s screen as much. This is hardly an upgrade, but another disappointment from Samsung.

                "review_text": "I am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications. I use LG, Pixel and Iphone, saw it all, and had reasons to abandon Samsung long time ago. Every cheap LG just worked better than Samsung for me. Decided to try S9 due it's small size; the only other option was Google Pixel but its display is just too bad. The only thing worse than the display are those large bezels, and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto-hide the soft buttons, when you want to get more out of that abysmal display. Heck, except in Youtube, the buttons are always there, making that 5\" screen more like 4.5\", in a body that's wider than S9. What a nonsense.. Anyway, S9 notifications: No notifications on locked screen: I have to take it, unlock, swipe down (needs both hands) and then I'll see notifications. Iphone/Pixel/nexus turns on the screen for a few seconds, I can see if it's anything interesting, if not I go with my work, the phone turns off the screen. Limited notifications on locked screen: Shows two lines vs full screen + scroll on iphone. Some settings available that don't help much. Androids in general are not that good as iphone, as they always are trying to bundle notifications. If you try to avoid that, at least they'll be bundled by the app. Raise to wakeup and show notifications: With iphone/Pixel/Nexus, I would pickup the phone and the accelerometar would wake up the phone, showing notifications. As soon as I put the phone down the screen goes off. When I pickup S9 nothing happens - again unlock and swipe procedure... Notifications while using the phone: Some message comes in, the phone does NOTHING. Sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it sounds, and sometimes it does show the popup. All this regardless of Notification Sounds settings and Silent mode. WTF ? App Icon number: Not reliably cleared or set on Google Inbox, Outlook, Google Play, to name a few. Note: some of these problems are tied to Notification Sound being off. So, they tied together Sound and Visual part of the notification system. Maybe that's good, but it's them who tried to distinguish between Visual and Sound Notifications in Settings. Naturally, these certainly are two different things as their use model is different. Samsung knows that but they failed to get it right. It's understandable why they failed - read below about the SW update I got. Anyway, sometimes some things work for a while (e.g. after I change different options) but then get broken again. Classical Samsung... All in all, I am relying on my Pebble to show me notifications. Some 3rd party apps allow coping with most of these problems but they are unreliable, sometimes power hungry or not persistent. So why Samsung doesn't care ? Well, just two days into Preorder (I already got my phone) and I get Software Update with important bug fixes. So, these guys are trying to deliver the software with zillion options so naturally it's not yet ready and is full of bugs. They start lots of things, and rarely nail a single one. First crazy option: Edge screen Notifications. You got to check out that hopeless attempt to implement ... ...i don't know what. Second crazy option: Turn On screensaver when screen is off. it's screen **saver** for a turned off screen ? WTF ? Third crazy option: Always on screen showing me the clock (duh) and that I have notifications... Sure I DO! I receive about hundred or more different notifications daily. The phone is ALWAYS in front of my face when working and driving - show me the notification, not an icon saying there's one... Fourth crazy option: You can enable vibration when you pickup the phone, if there was some notification. Duh, what about SHOWING that notification. I was thinking working hard getting different 3rd party apps until I fix the notifications to suit my needs. But still, that would leave me with the curved screen; Curved screen means there are no cases that allow comfortable grip as the case cannot extend fully above the LCD. I find much larger phones more comfortable in my hand - e.g. Samsung's own S8 Active, Pixel 2 XL with a proper case are easier to handle. So, my argument that I should get S9 because it's the smallest premium phone doesn't apply anymore. In addition, curved glass easily breaks as the glass is exposed. So many broken S8 phones around. I hear they've put much better **glass** into S9. Duh.. And not to forget the screen protector - THERE ARE NO GOOD glass screen protectors on the market (yet). I don't know what's wrong but glass protectors requires you to increase the screen sensitivity in the phone settings. Well, that option doesn't work good. I type fast and often use my phone for work email. I can't go and repeat every other letter. Also, glass screen protector, as of today, don't cover the full screen. In fact, they have some glue on the sides for the better grip, actually covering the whole curved edge. All in all, I am returning this one, and will wait to see what LG G7 will look like. Otherwise, will wait for Pixel 3. Until then, iphone 7, with all it's problems, is still a better deal for me than S9. Some notable positive sides: Samsung Internet browser is just awesome. LCD is excellent. Even better after Apple forcefully reduced the LCD brightness on iphone 7-, to \"help\" aged batteries. Don't know about iphone X, should be also close to 700nits like this one. Starting camera with double click to Power button. Photos *with flash* in dim conditions are ages ahead of the iphone. Home button is there - just press glass a bit harder. Speakerphone is much louder than Iphone 7. --------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE on screen wake-up on Notification: Googled a bit to see what can be done. Apparently, people mention that Samsung differs from IOS and stock Android in that you should depend on Edge light, LED light, vibration, sound, but not screen wake-up. So, Samsung tried to be more clever than Google or Apple. Lets see if they succeeded; I google a bit more and there are posts going back to 2015 about different issues: 1. Some people actually LIKE that there are no screen wakeup on Notifications. But their screen is WAKING UP ! S6, S7, S8, S9. People suggested lots of thing but nothing helped those poor souls. 2. Some people are like me and would want notification - just can't get them. 3. Some people argue why would somebody want to be in Group 2. Duh, what a bunch of schmucks - that should be a configurable option, to satisfy both groups, and no discussion needed. 3. Some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings - \"Wake Up screen on Notifications\". Well, that seems like it, except that I don't have such option. 4. There are reports on all kind of apps that will screw up the notifications. While Googling, a Verizon help page for S9 came up, showing that the screen will not turn on when... Outlook is installed. Aaaargh. I need that one for work. Anyway, after removing it and after doing the factory reset its still the same for me. I am reducing this to one star due to so many bugs. Started with Notifications, but I don't know what else is there...",

Also lost audio at 2 1/2 years of owning. My boyfriend shot some compressed air into the audio part and I could hear much better. But I had already ordered the S9 since I didn't think we could fix the audio on the S8. I'm having so many issues with it. I was on the phone with Verizon for 6 hours yesterday - different techs. After exhaustive trouble shooting, it was determined that I got a defective phone! What are the odds? When I try to google, email or text, I get knocked out into home screen. Very frustrating to try 8x to complete a 6 line text. Perhaps it's that the screen is too sensitive. It's not the apps - we put it in Safe Mode. We changed everything around including Samsung keyboard to Gboard, thinking that was the problem - wasn't. I'm glad that nobody else got a defective phone who has given a review. Aren't I the lucky one? I think I'm still lucky in other ways - it's hit and miss whether you get a functioning phone. New phone arriving tomorrow and will go to Verizon store for set up as I did with this phone. Wish me luck please! Thanks.",

                "review_text": "UPDATE (2/18/18): After having the phone 1 month, the one nit I have is with Android Auto on my Volt. Sometimes the 7x has problems keeping up (i.e. map screen is blank). The remedy is to reboot. But, I've had a love-hate relationship with Android Auto on my Nexus 6p too - not this particular problem but enough other things that makes me wonder how much real testing is done on the app. So, it's hard to say if it's the 7x or Google. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Unfortunately, my previous phone, the Nexus 6P (which was also Huawei-built) entered into the boot-loop of death this last weekend and I needed to get a new phone. Settling on a new phone is a life-decision for me because it's with me more than anything else that I own. I was looking for a short-term phone before the upcoming Galaxy 9 announcement and decided on the Honor 7x because of the reviews - the 7x was oxymoronically termed the \"premium budget\" phone. Once I bought a new flagship, I'd let the Honor 7x become a backup phone. Wow - I was not expecting this phone. What's great * Built Quality - it feels like a flagship * Snappy performance - enough said * Headphone jack - I'm a big user of bluetooth, but many times I don't want the hassle * Included case - another $20 that I don't need to spend * MicroSD slot - I like the option of more memory without having to pay extortion pricing for embedded memory * Low phone stress: At this price, I don't need to guard this phone like a Faberge egg (yes, I had to look up the spelling for that) What's not great and why it doesn't matter to me (i.e. would I pay an additional $400+ to get these features) * No Type-C: Yes, I'm trying to standardize on this but I've got plenty of microUSB devices now. I'm living in a mixed charger world for a while so I'm okay with it (but only this time) * Not OLED: Yes, my Nexus 6P was brighter. But, fixing a cracked OLED cost more than this phone (so I lived with a cracked screen) * Camera: I'm sure the camera isn't as good as the flagships but it doesn't move my $400 needle * Bezel - it has a small bezel. Who cares. * No fast charging: You need fast charging when your battery can't get you through the day - this battery will more than get you through the day * No 5GHz WiFi radio: It's loading apps and streaming videos plenty fast for me now. * No NFC: Since I can't depend on vendors accepting Android Pay, I've always got my credit cards with me. * Not waterproof: I'll just continue to be careful with the phone. * Not SnapDragon latest: As long as the performance is good - it doesn't matter. * I can't remember how to spell Hawui: But, I feel superior to others in that I can pronounce it. What's not great and may not matter to you: * Comes with Android 7, not Andriod 8. Given that only .2% of devices were on 8 you probably don't care about this. For me, it's inexcusable for a manufacturer to release a phone on an old OS. This is why when I transitioned from Apple to Android, I settled on the Google Nexus because I knew I would always get the latest. As a tech enthusiast, when I read about a new software feature that's available, I need to have it. But, the reality is that, unlike the old days when new major versions of OS's contained exciting and life-altering features, the last set of major releases have been kind of a yawn-fest. But, it's still important to me and how Huewai keeps pace with the latest releases will be a factor if I choose them again. Summing it up, great phone at a fantastic price. I would pay more if I needed to, but with the Honor 7x, it don't. IMHO, if you are buying a flagship phone from Samsung/Apple/Google, you're making a fashion statement. (but, I'll let you know if I change my opinion)",

                "review_text": "I have been an iphone fanatic for many years now, and while I still love their products, the iPhone X left me disappointed. The phones have just gotten so expensive and it seemed like there were some really cool phones available at a fraction of the price so i decided to take a gamble and try out the Honor 7x and I have to say that so far I have been incredibly impressed with how good this phone is! I think it is important to keep in mind that the phone is still $200 so of course things like its camera and processor won't compare flagship offerings such as the iPhone, Galaxy S8, or Pixel. However, the difference between this and those phones is very small considering the price difference and using a phone like this has made me skeptical of whether I can ever pay 1000 for a phone again. Below I have included the things that stood out the most to me while using the phone: Pros -Price: this phone is $200, but it feels like a much more expensive phone! You can buy 4 of these for the price of most flagship phones! -Design: feels like a premium model, similar design to the iPhone 7+ but with almost no bezel, really beautiful to hold and the metallic build makes it feel nice while holding -Micro SD Slot: one of the biggest advantages of using an android phone over an iPhone, so convenient to be able to expand your memory (especially now that you can download netflix and amazon prime movies) -Unlocked: always awesome to have an unlocked phone that you can easily travel with and the phone even includes dual sim capability so you don't have to swap multiple sim cards if you travel often -Screen: the screen looks great! the design is beautiful, it's awesome that there are almost no bezels (videos and pictures look fantastic) -Fingerprint Reader: the fingerprint reader works very quickly and consistently and I love the placement on the back of the phone. It's also really cool how its functions can be customized (so you can do things like snap a selfie with the fingerprint reader) -Performance: I wouldn't compare the speed of this to an expensive flagship, but so far I have noticed no issues with lag or slow downs while multitasking (im not a heavy gamer so not sure how that would perform) -Headphone Jack: still such a convenient way to use any pair of headphones you want and its still so nice to be able to easily plug your phone into your car or into some speakers at a party using an auxiliary cable -Battery Life: the battery life so far has been great, I have been able to easily get through a day and a half without having to recharge -Protective Case: comes with it's own clear protective gel case, nothing too fancy, but it's nice and slim and its really cool that it was included with the phone Cons -No USB C: For being a phone released in 2018 it was very sad to see that the phone still used a micro usb connection -No Water Resistance: having been using an iPhone 7 for a while it had become very comfortable to know that my phone could survive smaller water accidents -No NFC: not a feature I use too too much, but may be annoying for some people -Camera Quality: this is the main thing that would still make me invest in a more expensive phone. I use my phone camera alot and would really want something that is better quality and more reliable",

                "review_text": "DAY 4 UPDATES --------------------- I have mixed feelings (still positive though) about this phone knowing fully well that it's not a flagship phone and expectations should be toned down accordingly. Here are a few more updates - Battery life: have uploaded three more pictures that show the Screen On Time (it's amount of time screen was on and in use with battery starting at 100% and discharging to almost 0%). In my case, the battery discharged to 5% and the SOT was 4 hr 13 mins approx. This is not bad but it's not good either given the battery capacity. This is running the screen at 50% brightness, not running power saving mode and using the phone to play a couple of heavy games, watching youtube video, browsing and then some social media (all in all that's typical of an average user) - Performance: This is also mixed. I played Asphault 8 for about 10 minutes. The battery drained faster which is expected but the phone also became hot (backside upper part). Without the case, it felt hotter. The performance after this was not good at all, perhaps because the processor was throttled due to it being hot. Without playing games, the phone performs good but after playing a heavy game, it didn't perform well - apps took longer time to open and there was stutter in scrolling too - Bluetooth: it was easy to connect to any bluetooth enabled device once the phone had bluetooth on so it's all good here. However the issue was trying to switch on bluetooth from the pulldown menu. At least in my unit, it didn't work though I tried multiple times. Maybe it's a software defect. Will keep on trying. - Selfie Camera: this can be easily put in good category. The selfie camera to me at least pulled in better pictures than my iPhone 7 plus in day time and in dim light past evening. That's a major plus so happy with that. - Sound quality through headphone jack: it was good, infact very good. I tried the AKG earphones that came with Galaxy Note 8 and the sound quality was at par with Note 8. So happy with it I'll certainly lower the rating from 4.5 to 4 with the processor throttling and bluetooth switch on issue. Otherwise the experience has been good so far. DAY 1 UPDATES --------------------- I have always had flagship phones but was looking for a backup phone and thought that this would be a good candidate. I received this phone today so posting this review based on my initial impression of it. Will keep it very simple - what's in the box, what's there to like about this phone, what's not so good about the phone WHAT'S IN THE BOX - Phone with 5.93 inch display, IPS LCD panel - Charging brick and micro-USB cable - A TPU transparent case - SIM ejector tool Note: like other Huawei phones, was expecting that this phone will have a pre-installed screen protector but there isn't one WHAT'S THERE TO LIKE ABOUT THIS PHONE - Build Quality: it's excellent to say the least. Holding this you can't say that this is a $200 phone. It has a premium solid feel with no flex. Metal on the back and gorilla glass on the front - Looks: the phone looks good with aluminium back that is blue (check out the pictures). From the front too, it looks and feels modern and follows the current trend of 18:9 aspect ratio. - Fingerprint sensor: It's lightening fast and has always worked up until now. So overall very good - 3.5 mm audio jack: it's there. Putting this in the things to like section because even the most premium and expensive phones don't have this now. Example, iPhone, Huawei Mate 10 Pro, Google Pixel so it's really a luxury now-a-days - Software: this can be subjective for a lot of people but I do like EMUI software. The version is 5.1 which is not the latest but still EMUI is a good skin because it feels like a good mix of iPhone and Android (am a fan of iOS and this is a good mix) - Call Quality: It's very good. I am using T-mobile and getting a good signal in my area. It's comparable to my Galaxy Note 8. - Sound quality through bottom firing speaker: Again at this price, would definitely say that that sound quality is good. There's just one bottom firing speaker but its plenty loud. Not a lot of bass but enough clarity WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD ABOUT THIS PHONE - Rear Camera at night: I have taken just a few shots from this camera, mostly night time - a few of them indoor and a few of them outdoor. In both cases the images are falling apart. Indoor images have a blur so unless you hold the phone steady, you won't get a nice shot. Outdoor it doesn't capture enough light and the results are grainy photos. Will try to post some samples. - Use of micro-USB port for charging: In this day and age of USB type C, this phone comes with micro-USB. No way a deal breaker though. There's no fast charging but again with the price, it's ok A few more things: - Battery life: Though I have used this for a short period of time, the battery life at least for now appears to be good. After a couple of days, it would be possible to put this in the above two categories - Performance: This phone comes with Andoid Nougat and not the latest Oreo. It's a bit slower than flagship phones maybe due to the processor being mid-range. I know this phone shouldn't be compared with a flagship phone. - Rear camera in day time: yet to be tested during the day, will try to post some sample pictures - Selfie camera: yet to be tested both in day time and night time so would update in next few days - Sound Quality through headphone jack: would be able to update in next few days I would have rated this 4.5 given that it's not a flagship phone but that's not an option. In the end rated this as 4 because it's a bit behind in terms of both camera and performance",

It downloaded my 3 banking apps, credit card app, credit karma, Facebook, messenger, and pages all under six minutes. The UI is quite pleasant, as is all of the customization you can do to the phone itself. It's speedy and efficient, and feels like an expensive phone. No wonder Huawei is so big in Europe and India. UPDATE: After a month of heavy use I still enjoy this phone. It can be a little laggy and get hot if I'm running too many apps. I am pleased to say that it isn't glitchy often at all; it has only froze on me once. No dropped call complaints, and everything is clear and still running well. UPDATE: Here we are, April 4th and my Bluetooth doesn't work. The phone has been in a case and screen protector since day one. It's a huge shame I need Bluetooth for my business and after less than three full months of use a critical part of something for me is now broken.",

                "review_text": "TL;DR: Great bang for the buck. The screen is solid enough, providing \"true\" colors, viewing angles a bit weak. Overall call quality is decent. The exterior design is modern, looks like a flagship device, thin bezels, however, a bit uncomfortable to hold, wish it was more curvy. Performance is great for the price to performance ratio, wish it came with 4 GB of RAM, like what the international model has... Camera is great for this price range, strong in good lighting, a tad weak in lower lighting. Wish the overlay of EMUI was closer to stock Android. After much frustrations with the limitations of my Moto G, trying to run two apps at a time, it was time for a much needed upgrade. I'm not a \"power user\" when it comes to phones, I just need something that works for casual use, and that can be a handy tool. For $200, you're getting a lot of phone, thanks to the popularity of the Moto G, phones entering in the mid range market with a lot of bang for the buck, and Honor 7x so far has shown that is what it intends to do. The design of the phone looks as well as those high end phones 2 to 3 times the price, and the screen, camera and performance isn't so far off from those flagships. The screen being at 1080p, and nearing 6 inches is still very crisp, the viewing angles are a bit weak, and the colors are not as \"poppy\" as more expensive options, however... the colors seem to be \"true\" and not exaggerated, which I personally like. I'm glad this phone stuck to 1080p, I feel like the higher resolutions showing up on phones are not really needed, and just impact the overall performance, and battery life. Motorola phones, always had awesome call quality, I expect my phone to actually be able to function as a phone, crisp voices, incoming and outgoing, but for some reason, many phones fail at this, *cough* iPhones *cough.* The call quality on this Honor 7x is not that bad, could it be better? Yes. It works, it's crisp enough, it does sound better than some higher priced phones for sure, but it's not at the same level as Motorola phones. The exterior design takes some elements of the iPhone 6, in fact a bit too much to be fair, this could be a plus for some, a negative for others. Although it looks nice, and modern, I hate the flat design; it's somewhat uncomfortable to hold, might as well hold a brick, the first 3 generations of Moto E, G, X had it right with the curves that blend with the hand, I wish more manufactures took this approach to design. The performance of the phone is pretty snappy, no complaints for the price. I've been hitting my head against the wall using my Moto G the last year. It's really nice to be able to go through multiple applications, and not get hold ups, I really hope the 3 GB of RAM can hold up for at least 2-3 years, I'm a bit bummed that the U.S. model didn't get 4 GB of RAM like the international model(s). Cameras aren't super important to me, I don't have the desire to take a picture of every food dish I eat, of every tree I see, ect... I think for those moments I need to take a picture of video, the camera does pretty well; in good lighting, the camera does a great job, in lower level lighting, it's a bit weak. Compared to the god awful camera I've been using on the Moto G, this is personally a big (MASSIVE) upgrade in quality. I like to start off with a pure, or nearly pure stock Android, I'm not a big fan of skins over Android, most of them impact performance, and always seem a bit messy in terms of U.I. EMUI adds nothing for me, I don't know if I will eventually root this phone and clean it up, and/or install a custom ROM, if any actually get made and working... For now, I just uninstalled any of the bloatware apps I could, and disabled the ones I don't use, replaced the EMUI stock launcher with Nova launcher, and added a bit of my own personal touch. I wish after all the bloat manufactures add to there custom skin, I wish that they would have a setting where you could not only customize your navigation keys, BUT FREAKING RESIZE THEM!!! In fact, I wish Google actually would add that setting to begin with\u2026 Honor(Huawei) if your listening! Two features I would add to the software experience is the resizing of the navigation keys, and navigation gestures to the fingerprint sensor: swipe left to go back, swipe right to go to recent apps, swipe up to go home. Overall, great device, I'm glad I decided to purchase it, rather than going with a Moto G5 plus. Hopefully the device will last me for at least 2-3 years without much headache.",

I got a new generation i7 desktop at $550. I still get $350 left for other proposes. The look of the phone is amazing, Much better than iPhone 7 plus. As well the screen is larger. The Fingerprint lock is so good which can unlock phone fast and correctly. The fingerprint lock on old iPhones are just too slow and keep failing. The processor on the phone is much faster than my old iPhone. Apps response fast. I guess the phone is the key for huawei to open the us market. Great phones with really low price. Will they beat Samsung in the coming years? Maybe and hopefully. Update: After a week of uses. The phone turned slow when I opening apps or switching one app to the other. Probably I can't expect to much for the 659 cpu but I don't really open more than two apps at the same time. Sometimes I close up some apps but don't see the Ram frees more spaces. I think the problem is on the weak cpu or the lack of Ram. So I downgrade the phone from five to three.",

                "review_text": "Update 04-08-2018: I've had the phone for over a month now and it's still great. Every few days I have to reboot it because it does seem to slow down...but rebooting a phone every 5 days it's a problem to me at all. It does charge slowly, but again, not an issue for me. Plugging it in at 10% easily gets to 100% overnight. The battery life is still amazing. I use it heavily throughout the day and it's still at 50% or more by the time I go to bed. Typically I charge it every two days or maybe top it off a little bit if needed. I had an Axon 7 (which I absolutely loved) but the battery would only last a few hours so decided it was time for a new phone. I couldn't find anything with the nice specs of my Axon 7 so decided to settle for this phone until something better came along. I was totally shocked how good this phone is. It totally buries my Axon 7 on boot up and is very responsive. I didn't particularly care for the UI so replaced it with Nova launcher. I was a bit worried whether it would work correctly because other reviewers said they had problems getting it to work. I had no issues at all. I use T-Mobile and MMS wouldn't work at all the first day, but by the next day it was working...not sure what's up with that (I'm using Textra). The phone does lack a few things that would be nice, but they are absolutely not deal breakers. USB-C would have been nice, but I have a ton of the old cables, so that's not a problem. An IR blaster would be nice, but to be honest I haven't really used those on my old phones and they had them. My biggest gripe at this point might be the sound. It's ok, but nothing special at all. Perhaps it's because I was spoiled by the Axon 7, but I'd rather have a phone with a mediocre speaker than one I had to charge 3 times a day. The battery life is amazing. I started off the day with 67% charged. I listened to an audio book to and from work (40 minute commute each way), had waze on for 40 minutes, made a few phone calls and listened to music all day...about 8 hours (screen off). By the time I got home the charge was down to 45%!! This beats the heck out of any other phone I had and used this much. The phone looks and feels great...it doesn't feel like I only spent $199 on it. The great part is watching others go spend $1000 on a new iPhone and realize that my 7x is just as functional and I could have 5 of them.",

I wasn't expecting much for the price so it has exceeded my expectations. The only thing it doesn't have that I wish it did is fast charging. I haven't had it long enough to say how big a deal that is but it sure would have been nice. The other odd quirk I've found is that you can't transfer apps to the SD card. You can store files on it but not apps which is strange. Again, I'm not sure how big a deal that will be over time. For the price, at least initially, the phone is well worth it.",

                "review_text": "I love this phone! It's my second $200 phone (the first was the galaxy j7 prime) and this one is miles better. The camera is much better and that was my biggest concern. The screen is really big but it's still easy to use one-handed. The fingerprint scanner is incredibly well placed and works immediately every time. The battery also easily lasts all day and I'm on my phone constantly. Something kind of funny is that the stock keyboard come with what I assume is Chinese emojis and they're hilarious. I originally came from the galaxy s7 edge and this phone really doesn't feel like that much of a step down for saving $700 dollars. The camera isn't as good but that's a lot of money too pay for a camera. As you can tell, I've been a Samsung girl for a while and switching to an almost stock Android has been great. I always thought I liked the little changes Samsung made but now I think they would just get in the way. There are a few cons. First is that you need to either put the free case on it or get a screen protector immediately. The corners of the front screen got scratched up after having the phone for less than a day just from setting it face down on tables. Also, Snapchat occasionally runs slow. And finally, I would suggest resetting your phone every so often because it does get bogged down sometimes.",

                "review_text": "UPDATE (2/18/18): After having the phone 1 month, the one nit I have is with Android Auto on my Volt. Sometimes the 7x has problems keeping up (i.e. map screen is blank). The remedy is to reboot. But, I've had a love-hate relationship with Android Auto on my Nexus 6p too - not this particular problem but enough other things that makes me wonder how much real testing is done on the app. So, it's hard to say if it's the 7x or Google. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Unfortunately, my previous phone, the Nexus 6P (which was also Huawei-built) entered into the boot-loop of death this last weekend and I needed to get a new phone. Settling on a new phone is a life-decision for me because it's with me more than anything else that I own. I was looking for a short-term phone before the upcoming Galaxy 9 announcement and decided on the Honor 7x because of the reviews - the 7x was oxymoronically termed the \"premium budget\" phone. Once I bought a new flagship, I'd let the Honor 7x become a backup phone. Wow - I was not expecting this phone. What's great * Built Quality - it feels like a flagship * Snappy performance - enough said * Headphone jack - I'm a big user of bluetooth, but many times I don't want the hassle * Included case - another $20 that I don't need to spend * MicroSD slot - I like the option of more memory without having to pay extortion pricing for embedded memory * Low phone stress: At this price, I don't need to guard this phone like a Faberge egg (yes, I had to look up the spelling for that) What's not great and why it doesn't matter to me (i.e. would I pay an additional $400+ to get these features) * No Type-C: Yes, I'm trying to standardize on this but I've got plenty of microUSB devices now. I'm living in a mixed charger world for a while so I'm okay with it (but only this time) * Not OLED: Yes, my Nexus 6P was brighter. But, fixing a cracked OLED cost more than this phone (so I lived with a cracked screen) * Camera: I'm sure the camera isn't as good as the flagships but it doesn't move my $400 needle * Bezel - it has a small bezel. Who cares. * No fast charging: You need fast charging when your battery can't get you through the day - this battery will more than get you through the day * No 5GHz WiFi radio: It's loading apps and streaming videos plenty fast for me now. * No NFC: Since I can't depend on vendors accepting Android Pay, I've always got my credit cards with me. * Not waterproof: I'll just continue to be careful with the phone. * Not SnapDragon latest: As long as the performance is good - it doesn't matter. * I can't remember how to spell Hawui: But, I feel superior to others in that I can pronounce it. What's not great and may not matter to you: * Comes with Android 7, not Andriod 8. Given that only .2% of devices were on 8 you probably don't care about this. For me, it's inexcusable for a manufacturer to release a phone on an old OS. This is why when I transitioned from Apple to Android, I settled on the Google Nexus because I knew I would always get the latest. As a tech enthusiast, when I read about a new software feature that's available, I need to have it. But, the reality is that, unlike the old days when new major versions of OS's contained exciting and life-altering features, the last set of major releases have been kind of a yawn-fest. But, it's still important to me and how Huewai keeps pace with the latest releases will be a factor if I choose them again. Summing it up, great phone at a fantastic price. I would pay more if I needed to, but with the Honor 7x, it don't. IMHO, if you are buying a flagship phone from Samsung/Apple/Google, you're making a fashion statement. (but, I'll let you know if I change my opinion)",

                "review_text": "I have been an iphone fanatic for many years now, and while I still love their products, the iPhone X left me disappointed. The phones have just gotten so expensive and it seemed like there were some really cool phones available at a fraction of the price so i decided to take a gamble and try out the Honor 7x and I have to say that so far I have been incredibly impressed with how good this phone is! I think it is important to keep in mind that the phone is still $200 so of course things like its camera and processor won't compare flagship offerings such as the iPhone, Galaxy S8, or Pixel. However, the difference between this and those phones is very small considering the price difference and using a phone like this has made me skeptical of whether I can ever pay 1000 for a phone again. Below I have included the things that stood out the most to me while using the phone: Pros -Price: this phone is $200, but it feels like a much more expensive phone! You can buy 4 of these for the price of most flagship phones! -Design: feels like a premium model, similar design to the iPhone 7+ but with almost no bezel, really beautiful to hold and the metallic build makes it feel nice while holding -Micro SD Slot: one of the biggest advantages of using an android phone over an iPhone, so convenient to be able to expand your memory (especially now that you can download netflix and amazon prime movies) -Unlocked: always awesome to have an unlocked phone that you can easily travel with and the phone even includes dual sim capability so you don't have to swap multiple sim cards if you travel often -Screen: the screen looks great! the design is beautiful, it's awesome that there are almost no bezels (videos and pictures look fantastic) -Fingerprint Reader: the fingerprint reader works very quickly and consistently and I love the placement on the back of the phone. It's also really cool how its functions can be customized (so you can do things like snap a selfie with the fingerprint reader) -Performance: I wouldn't compare the speed of this to an expensive flagship, but so far I have noticed no issues with lag or slow downs while multitasking (im not a heavy gamer so not sure how that would perform) -Headphone Jack: still such a convenient way to use any pair of headphones you want and its still so nice to be able to easily plug your phone into your car or into some speakers at a party using an auxiliary cable -Battery Life: the battery life so far has been great, I have been able to easily get through a day and a half without having to recharge -Protective Case: comes with it's own clear protective gel case, nothing too fancy, but it's nice and slim and its really cool that it was included with the phone Cons -No USB C: For being a phone released in 2018 it was very sad to see that the phone still used a micro usb connection -No Water Resistance: having been using an iPhone 7 for a while it had become very comfortable to know that my phone could survive smaller water accidents -No NFC: not a feature I use too too much, but may be annoying for some people -Camera Quality: this is the main thing that would still make me invest in a more expensive phone. I use my phone camera alot and would really want something that is better quality and more reliable",

                "review_text": "DAY 4 UPDATES --------------------- I have mixed feelings (still positive though) about this phone knowing fully well that it's not a flagship phone and expectations should be toned down accordingly. Here are a few more updates - Battery life: have uploaded three more pictures that show the Screen On Time (it's amount of time screen was on and in use with battery starting at 100% and discharging to almost 0%). In my case, the battery discharged to 5% and the SOT was 4 hr 13 mins approx. This is not bad but it's not good either given the battery capacity. This is running the screen at 50% brightness, not running power saving mode and using the phone to play a couple of heavy games, watching youtube video, browsing and then some social media (all in all that's typical of an average user) - Performance: This is also mixed. I played Asphault 8 for about 10 minutes. The battery drained faster which is expected but the phone also became hot (backside upper part). Without the case, it felt hotter. The performance after this was not good at all, perhaps because the processor was throttled due to it being hot. Without playing games, the phone performs good but after playing a heavy game, it didn't perform well - apps took longer time to open and there was stutter in scrolling too - Bluetooth: it was easy to connect to any bluetooth enabled device once the phone had bluetooth on so it's all good here. However the issue was trying to switch on bluetooth from the pulldown menu. At least in my unit, it didn't work though I tried multiple times. Maybe it's a software defect. Will keep on trying. - Selfie Camera: this can be easily put in good category. The selfie camera to me at least pulled in better pictures than my iPhone 7 plus in day time and in dim light past evening. That's a major plus so happy with that. - Sound quality through headphone jack: it was good, infact very good. I tried the AKG earphones that came with Galaxy Note 8 and the sound quality was at par with Note 8. So happy with it I'll certainly lower the rating from 4.5 to 4 with the processor throttling and bluetooth switch on issue. Otherwise the experience has been good so far. DAY 1 UPDATES --------------------- I have always had flagship phones but was looking for a backup phone and thought that this would be a good candidate. I received this phone today so posting this review based on my initial impression of it. Will keep it very simple - what's in the box, what's there to like about this phone, what's not so good about the phone WHAT'S IN THE BOX - Phone with 5.93 inch display, IPS LCD panel - Charging brick and micro-USB cable - A TPU transparent case - SIM ejector tool Note: like other Huawei phones, was expecting that this phone will have a pre-installed screen protector but there isn't one WHAT'S THERE TO LIKE ABOUT THIS PHONE - Build Quality: it's excellent to say the least. Holding this you can't say that this is a $200 phone. It has a premium solid feel with no flex. Metal on the back and gorilla glass on the front - Looks: the phone looks good with aluminium back that is blue (check out the pictures). From the front too, it looks and feels modern and follows the current trend of 18:9 aspect ratio. - Fingerprint sensor: It's lightening fast and has always worked up until now. So overall very good - 3.5 mm audio jack: it's there. Putting this in the things to like section because even the most premium and expensive phones don't have this now. Example, iPhone, Huawei Mate 10 Pro, Google Pixel so it's really a luxury now-a-days - Software: this can be subjective for a lot of people but I do like EMUI software. The version is 5.1 which is not the latest but still EMUI is a good skin because it feels like a good mix of iPhone and Android (am a fan of iOS and this is a good mix) - Call Quality: It's very good. I am using T-mobile and getting a good signal in my area. It's comparable to my Galaxy Note 8. - Sound quality through bottom firing speaker: Again at this price, would definitely say that that sound quality is good. There's just one bottom firing speaker but its plenty loud. Not a lot of bass but enough clarity WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD ABOUT THIS PHONE - Rear Camera at night: I have taken just a few shots from this camera, mostly night time - a few of them indoor and a few of them outdoor. In both cases the images are falling apart. Indoor images have a blur so unless you hold the phone steady, you won't get a nice shot. Outdoor it doesn't capture enough light and the results are grainy photos. Will try to post some samples. - Use of micro-USB port for charging: In this day and age of USB type C, this phone comes with micro-USB. No way a deal breaker though. There's no fast charging but again with the price, it's ok A few more things: - Battery life: Though I have used this for a short period of time, the battery life at least for now appears to be good. After a couple of days, it would be possible to put this in the above two categories - Performance: This phone comes with Andoid Nougat and not the latest Oreo. It's a bit slower than flagship phones maybe due to the processor being mid-range. I know this phone shouldn't be compared with a flagship phone. - Rear camera in day time: yet to be tested during the day, will try to post some sample pictures - Selfie camera: yet to be tested both in day time and night time so would update in next few days - Sound Quality through headphone jack: would be able to update in next few days I would have rated this 4.5 given that it's not a flagship phone but that's not an option. In the end rated this as 4 because it's a bit behind in terms of both camera and performance",

It downloaded my 3 banking apps, credit card app, credit karma, Facebook, messenger, and pages all under six minutes. The UI is quite pleasant, as is all of the customization you can do to the phone itself. It's speedy and efficient, and feels like an expensive phone. No wonder Huawei is so big in Europe and India. UPDATE: After a month of heavy use I still enjoy this phone. It can be a little laggy and get hot if I'm running too many apps. I am pleased to say that it isn't glitchy often at all; it has only froze on me once. No dropped call complaints, and everything is clear and still running well. UPDATE: Here we are, April 4th and my Bluetooth doesn't work. The phone has been in a case and screen protector since day one. It's a huge shame I need Bluetooth for my business and after less than three full months of use a critical part of something for me is now broken.",

                "review_text": "TL;DR: Great bang for the buck. The screen is solid enough, providing \"true\" colors, viewing angles a bit weak. Overall call quality is decent. The exterior design is modern, looks like a flagship device, thin bezels, however, a bit uncomfortable to hold, wish it was more curvy. Performance is great for the price to performance ratio, wish it came with 4 GB of RAM, like what the international model has... Camera is great for this price range, strong in good lighting, a tad weak in lower lighting. Wish the overlay of EMUI was closer to stock Android. After much frustrations with the limitations of my Moto G, trying to run two apps at a time, it was time for a much needed upgrade. I'm not a \"power user\" when it comes to phones, I just need something that works for casual use, and that can be a handy tool. For $200, you're getting a lot of phone, thanks to the popularity of the Moto G, phones entering in the mid range market with a lot of bang for the buck, and Honor 7x so far has shown that is what it intends to do. The design of the phone looks as well as those high end phones 2 to 3 times the price, and the screen, camera and performance isn't so far off from those flagships. The screen being at 1080p, and nearing 6 inches is still very crisp, the viewing angles are a bit weak, and the colors are not as \"poppy\" as more expensive options, however... the colors seem to be \"true\" and not exaggerated, which I personally like. I'm glad this phone stuck to 1080p, I feel like the higher resolutions showing up on phones are not really needed, and just impact the overall performance, and battery life. Motorola phones, always had awesome call quality, I expect my phone to actually be able to function as a phone, crisp voices, incoming and outgoing, but for some reason, many phones fail at this, *cough* iPhones *cough.* The call quality on this Honor 7x is not that bad, could it be better? Yes. It works, it's crisp enough, it does sound better than some higher priced phones for sure, but it's not at the same level as Motorola phones. The exterior design takes some elements of the iPhone 6, in fact a bit too much to be fair, this could be a plus for some, a negative for others. Although it looks nice, and modern, I hate the flat design; it's somewhat uncomfortable to hold, might as well hold a brick, the first 3 generations of Moto E, G, X had it right with the curves that blend with the hand, I wish more manufactures took this approach to design. The performance of the phone is pretty snappy, no complaints for the price. I've been hitting my head against the wall using my Moto G the last year. It's really nice to be able to go through multiple applications, and not get hold ups, I really hope the 3 GB of RAM can hold up for at least 2-3 years, I'm a bit bummed that the U.S. model didn't get 4 GB of RAM like the international model(s). Cameras aren't super important to me, I don't have the desire to take a picture of every food dish I eat, of every tree I see, ect... I think for those moments I need to take a picture of video, the camera does pretty well; in good lighting, the camera does a great job, in lower level lighting, it's a bit weak. Compared to the god awful camera I've been using on the Moto G, this is personally a big (MASSIVE) upgrade in quality. I like to start off with a pure, or nearly pure stock Android, I'm not a big fan of skins over Android, most of them impact performance, and always seem a bit messy in terms of U.I. EMUI adds nothing for me, I don't know if I will eventually root this phone and clean it up, and/or install a custom ROM, if any actually get made and working... For now, I just uninstalled any of the bloatware apps I could, and disabled the ones I don't use, replaced the EMUI stock launcher with Nova launcher, and added a bit of my own personal touch. I wish after all the bloat manufactures add to there custom skin, I wish that they would have a setting where you could not only customize your navigation keys, BUT FREAKING RESIZE THEM!!! In fact, I wish Google actually would add that setting to begin with\u2026 Honor(Huawei) if your listening! Two features I would add to the software experience is the resizing of the navigation keys, and navigation gestures to the fingerprint sensor: swipe left to go back, swipe right to go to recent apps, swipe up to go home. Overall, great device, I'm glad I decided to purchase it, rather than going with a Moto G5 plus. Hopefully the device will last me for at least 2-3 years without much headache.",

I got a new generation i7 desktop at $550. I still get $350 left for other proposes. The look of the phone is amazing, Much better than iPhone 7 plus. As well the screen is larger. The Fingerprint lock is so good which can unlock phone fast and correctly. The fingerprint lock on old iPhones are just too slow and keep failing. The processor on the phone is much faster than my old iPhone. Apps response fast. I guess the phone is the key for huawei to open the us market. Great phones with really low price. Will they beat Samsung in the coming years? Maybe and hopefully. Update: After a week of uses. The phone turned slow when I opening apps or switching one app to the other. Probably I can't expect to much for the 659 cpu but I don't really open more than two apps at the same time. Sometimes I close up some apps but don't see the Ram frees more spaces. I think the problem is on the weak cpu or the lack of Ram. So I downgrade the phone from five to three.",

                "review_text": "Update 04-08-2018: I've had the phone for over a month now and it's still great. Every few days I have to reboot it because it does seem to slow down...but rebooting a phone every 5 days it's a problem to me at all. It does charge slowly, but again, not an issue for me. Plugging it in at 10% easily gets to 100% overnight. The battery life is still amazing. I use it heavily throughout the day and it's still at 50% or more by the time I go to bed. Typically I charge it every two days or maybe top it off a little bit if needed. I had an Axon 7 (which I absolutely loved) but the battery would only last a few hours so decided it was time for a new phone. I couldn't find anything with the nice specs of my Axon 7 so decided to settle for this phone until something better came along. I was totally shocked how good this phone is. It totally buries my Axon 7 on boot up and is very responsive. I didn't particularly care for the UI so replaced it with Nova launcher. I was a bit worried whether it would work correctly because other reviewers said they had problems getting it to work. I had no issues at all. I use T-Mobile and MMS wouldn't work at all the first day, but by the next day it was working...not sure what's up with that (I'm using Textra). The phone does lack a few things that would be nice, but they are absolutely not deal breakers. USB-C would have been nice, but I have a ton of the old cables, so that's not a problem. An IR blaster would be nice, but to be honest I haven't really used those on my old phones and they had them. My biggest gripe at this point might be the sound. It's ok, but nothing special at all. Perhaps it's because I was spoiled by the Axon 7, but I'd rather have a phone with a mediocre speaker than one I had to charge 3 times a day. The battery life is amazing. I started off the day with 67% charged. I listened to an audio book to and from work (40 minute commute each way), had waze on for 40 minutes, made a few phone calls and listened to music all day...about 8 hours (screen off). By the time I got home the charge was down to 45%!! This beats the heck out of any other phone I had and used this much. The phone looks and feels great...it doesn't feel like I only spent $199 on it. The great part is watching others go spend $1000 on a new iPhone and realize that my 7x is just as functional and I could have 5 of them.",

I wasn't expecting much for the price so it has exceeded my expectations. The only thing it doesn't have that I wish it did is fast charging. I haven't had it long enough to say how big a deal that is but it sure would have been nice. The other odd quirk I've found is that you can't transfer apps to the SD card. You can store files on it but not apps which is strange. Again, I'm not sure how big a deal that will be over time. For the price, at least initially, the phone is well worth it.",

The camera is much better and that was my biggest concern. The screen is really big but it's still easy to use one-handed. The fingerprint scanner is incredibly well placed and works immediately every time. The battery also easily lasts all day and I'm on my phone constantly. Something kind of funny is that the stock keyboard come with what I assume is Chinese emojis and they're hilarious. I originally came from the galaxy s7 edge and this phone really doesn't feel like that much of a step down for saving $700 dollars. The camera isn't as good but that's a lot of money too pay for a camera. As you can tell, I've been a Samsung girl for a while and switching to an almost stock Android has been great. I always thought I liked the little changes Samsung made but now I think they would just get in the way. There are a few cons. First is that you need to either put the free case on it or get a screen protector immediately. The corners of the front screen got scratched up after having the phone for less than a day just from setting it face down on tables. Also, Snapchat occasionally runs slow. And finally, I would suggest resetting your phone every so often because it does get bogged down sometimes.",

                "review_text": "If you have read any of my other reviews, you know I like phones and test drive MANY in search of really good phones, were kind of s phone family. Having said that, I am a Huawei fan since the Mate 2. They just build good phones for an incredible price. We have owned all the high end Mates and everything since the Honor 5 to this phone, the 7x. I say that to say, I don't mind paying more for a good phone...but the Honor line has made it so I don't have to pay more for a quality phone with really good specs. I never would have imagined a $200 phone could be this good. The photos are a side by side comparison to the Honor 5, for size comparison. The first thing I noticed about this phone is how remarkably thin it is for an almost 6 inch screen, with three cameras (two on back, one forward facing) It's much lighter and thinner than the 5, yet feels more solid in the hand. This phone has a nice large battery and I'm sure it will last my husband all day, with moderate text and web use. It uses a micro USB charger, which is fine for most people who still have a ton of micro USB chargers around (I personally prefer type C, but my husband hates change and likes the micro USB). Even though the screen is almost 6 inches, it doesn't feel too large..and definitely feels smaller than my Mate 9. The screen is bright and the resolution looks great. ALL my husband's apps and data transferred over (all 64 apps) within 16 minutes with the phone clone app that Huawei uses for data and app transfer. The phone is super fast and switched between apps quickly with no freezing or lag (yet). The UI is typical Huawei, but you can download the google launcher or other launcher of your choice to give a more familiar feel. We use cricket (which is AT&T prepaid) and had no issues with the APN, it configured automatically. Placed a call and the sound was good and definitely loud enough on speaker. The camera is good...it's not the Mate 9 Leica but it's good and I didn't feel the need to mess with any settings. Is plenty good for social media pics, selfies and pics of the kids, pets, life's most embarrassing moments, etc. It still has a headphone jack, which I prefer to an adapter or even wireless. The finger print sensor is lightning fast and works before you even realize you have pressed your finger against the sensor. Not too much bloatware, certainly not as much as carrier locked phones! It has 64 GB of space, AND room for a memory card. Comes with Android 8 which is pretty similar to 7, but nice to have updated out of the box. It encrypts the SD card so be aware if you choose this option that you won't be able to just pop your SD card out of this phone and into another without changing the settings. Time will tell, but based on prior experience with Huawei, as well an Apple, Samsung and various bargain phones, I believe this is another keeper! It's a shame AT&T backed out of the deal to bring this phone to the carrier, but it may work to the consumers advantage by keeping prices competitive. DAY THREE of heavy use and no glitches, lagging, freezing or resets. Love this phone more worth each passing day.",

With prices of phones getting higher and higher I was looking for something that wasn't so expensive; I'd just returned the Mate 10 Pro for this very reason and decided to stick with Honor/Huawei. I love that it gets VoLTE on my carrier (T-mobile), and that it includes a case in the box - definitely something other phone companies need to do. The handfeel is a HUGE improvement over the 6x, and though it's not what the market considers premium (glass) I like that if I went without a case the device would probably be ok too. So far battery life has been about what my 6x was able to do, and for my usage/needs that's more than enough - I can get through a day in with 60% remaining, and that suites me just fine. I'm not a gamer, my apps are mostly time killers/utility apps, but I haven't had the device slow when switching or freeze while trying to load something. EMUI isn't something that's a deal breaker for me, in fact I love that it has features that I sometimes have to unlock with an app or ADB on other devices (night mode, fingerprint scanner gestures, mobile hotspot toggle, data toggle, etc); about the only thing I wish it would include is the ability to load customer icons and/or make the default icons smaller. Overall for what I paid for the phone I'm extremely satisfied right now, even if it does get an Android 8.0 update I'll still consider this money well spent as the feature set is pretty killer. There's some good competition in this space, so definitely look around but I'm happy with my purchase.",

Cons- No 5ghz WiFi. No fast charge, it takes a long time to fully charge. No wifi calling Second sim only 2G, you can still text but I don\u2019t know if it can handle picture messages on 2G No native mail app. You must use a third party mail app. Yahoo, google. I think it has some form of ad software installed. The usb connection to most new car radios does not allow you to play music or streaming apps from the phone. That can only be done with Bluetooth. This might just be an Android thing and not a phone thing. My iPhones have always worked with the usb connection. Android messages.. this is by far the worst feature of an Android phone. There is no comparison to iMessage on the iPhone. It has limited features and a character limit.. seriously? Its 2018 and text are limited to 160 characters \ud83d\ude44. If you are a heavy texter which I am not, Android isn\u2019t for you if you are coming from an iPhone. I guess some of my review is about the Android 7 OS. \ud83d\ude02 I feel like I am using Windoze again. It\u2019s not too bad but If you are tech savvy you can figure it out. I\u2019ll keep using it for a couple of weeks and if my opinion changes I\u2019ll update my review. If you are looking for a good value then this is the phone for you. For $200, you can\u2019t go wrong. UPDATE.. Well, I spoke to soon.. I am returning the phone. It is now locking up. I have to constantly reboot it, I have had to reset it and when I install a few apps it starts happening again. I am guessing it\u2019s the Android OS that is the problem but.. if the OS won\u2019t run correctly it doesn\u2019t matter how good the hardware is. I am not a gamer or a frequent texter.. I do use a few social media apps and shopping apps, that\u2019s about it.. still a good value if you can deal with the android OS.",

                "review_text": "The Honor 7X is a great device, you're getting a lot of value for the price. Compared to other smartphones within the price range, the Honor 7X is a no-brainer. I was planning to wait until Motorola announced the Moto G6. And I even considered getting the Moto G5 Plus since it's on sale. But with everything happening to Motorola recently, who knows what their future is. Huawei did launch the Mate SE out of no where recently, but the extra $50 for the exact same specs other than the extra gig of ram and doubled storage isn't worth it for me since it still launched with Nougat, still uses micro usb, and I use a 64GB micro SD card anyways. Back to the 7X, I did have this phone originally in black, but due to a hardware defect, I sent it back and ordered it in blue since it was the only color that was in stock. And to be honest, I should have went with the blue color in the first place, it's so nice! And blue's not even my favorite color! It's darker than what's pictured, almost like a navy blue. Having owned the black version of the 7X prior as well as many other black devices previously, the blue definitely adds more style to the device, along with the gray lines on the back. If you're undecided on which color to get, I recommend the blue color! It's a very nice and unique color for a smartphone. The screen is big and crisp, audio is clear, and build quality is definitely a step up from the older Honor 6X. The battery lasts me a full day and I still have about 40% left before the day ends, even with normal usage (facebook, youtube, chrome, reddit, 9GAG, etc.). I don't really play resource hungry games on my phone. And I do like my screen rather bright, so the battery is very good. The camera also got a noticeable upgrade. The camera features and aperture effect are great as they were in the 6X! The downloadable themes and customizable LED notification light are also always pluses for me. I have had zero issues with performance or touch responsiveness on my 7X. There are however, a couple of issues that I would like to address about the Honor 7X. First, the device seems to make a rattle noise when it is tapped or knocked on in the upper half on the back. Now that I've owned 2 of these devices, I am certain that this is normal and nothing is loose inside the phone. Nothing major, just a minor annoyance. Second, the current update B140 has an issue where the screen dims automatically whenever you open an app with a white background. Even with auto brightness disabled. The only way to remedy that issue is turning up the brightness to about 90%, which is what I run mine at anyways. I am unsure if Honor knows about this issue and if they will fix it. A lot of users though, have this same issue. It even occurs in the new Mate SE. So it's definitely a EMUI bug that needs to be addressed and fixed. I owned the Honor 6X just 4 months before getting this new version, the 7X. But I definitely should have waited. If you have a 6X and are happy with it, hold off until the 7X gets the official Oreo and EMUI 8 updates. If you need a new phone though, I'd say go ahead and grab the 7X, it's hard to beat for $200!",

This time I decided to give it another try due to the shiny body and ovehemeingly good review. It really didn't dispoint me this time. The display is even better than I thought when I got the phone. I have heard view angle issue of phone but I don't see anything noticeable. Clarity of display are top notch!! Even feel better than iPhone 7 or 8. The performance is greatly improved from last generation. What is even better is it flies after I turned on developer option and limit the background process. I haven't tried the camera seriously, it is ok. But if care about camera, it is not the phone for you. I don't really have too much cons for it. The micro USB ports, lack of fast charge don't seem like a problem because I have plenty of old cable and battery is well enough for serious one day use. One con I have is that edge of the screen is not very sensitive , but not a big issue to me. So seriously, even without considering the fact of price, it is still a perfect daily driver phone.",

This is actually my first Android phone, and switched because I couldn't afford Apple anymore. I always enjoyed the iPhone look so EMUI is very nice. All of the default apps are great. Battery is great and usually lasts a little under a day and a half for me. The camera isn't amazing, but good for the price point. With such a low price I could always buy a professional camera and still spend less than I would if I were to purchase a flagship phone from Samsung or Apple.",

That thing barely lasted half a day and if I used something heavy like maps, it would be instant death. I wasn't sure what to expect from this phone, but I couldn't afford a pricey iPhone X or Google Pixel. I have been so far pleasantly surprised. I'd say this phone works better and faster than my old iPhone ever did. I can now open apps and type words into search bars without it having to think about it and my battery lasts all day long. It's also extremely touch sensitive, something I had to get used to after my less touch sensitive iPhone. I can't say good enough things about this phone. The only downside is the screen will be less crisp than a more expensive one and the camera isn't top of the line crystal clear. I've added a photo to give you an idea. Still this phone is great and definitely is an exception to you get what you pay for. More phones should be this reasonably priced. I will recommend to everyone who wants a new phone that feels like an expensive top of the line one but can't afford it. Also I had cricket and switching over was as easy as taking my SIM card out of my iPhone and putting it in this one.",

The OnePlus was slowing down quite a bit, so I sold it and took a portion of the proceeds and gave the Honor 7x a try. I owned the Honor 5x a few years ago, and had a decent experience with it. Like I said, so far, so great. I'm only 6 hours into the experience, but I can say that this is one impressive phone for the price. I did quite a bit of homework before purchasing and was between a few devices, but this was the only one under $300 that I was considering. The screen ratio is one of the best aspects of the phone. The build is solid and the software layer is pretty usable. I haven't yet needed to go to Nova. If you put this in front of anyone with a bit of knowledge about the landscape of phones out there, I would bet they would guess that this phone is priced between $300-$400. Will update after a week of use. Don't hesitate...buy, buy, buy!",

So what you want to know are the Cons of the phone since everyone else has already explained all the Pros. However one thing that did shock me was how good the fingerprint reader was 10/10 so fast. So onto Cons. Cons- VIBRATION SUCKS, like damn this motor is weak af, good thing the sound is loud enough Lot of bloat with the phone Camera is fine not great not bad Heavy skin of Emui but its not too in your face (Micro usb is maybe a con for some but I have a ton of old cables so its nice not having to buy new ones) Overall my second $200 dollar phone and compared to the zenphone out of the box, its not anything to blow your mind performance wise but right away it feels and looks SO much more premium alike something that would cost $500 bucks. If your looking into this phone right now I definitely recommend getting it if your budget is similar to mine or if you need a cheap phone. Oh and i'm on T-mobile and it seems to work fine.",

                "review_text": "OVERALL - Great phone for the price. As of the date of this review, the phone is hard to beat in this price range. The mid-range processor can handle most app's and games without issue. However, there are some issues that'll be addressed below. SOFTWARE - The software, EMUI 5.1, will definitely leave you polarized. You'll either like it or you won't. It has an iOS look and feel to it. I bought Nova Launcher Prime and use that as the replacement launcher. The Honor 7x is set to receive Android Oreo updates sometime in Q2 2018. HARDWARE - The Honor 7x has Huawei Kirin 695 processor. It's mid-range spec and is definitely capable of handling the day in and day out's of your average consumer. I've been able to play each game I've downloaded flawlessly. My issue is that the phone gets very hot in the back right corner at the top after an hour or more of intensive use such as playing a game, and I'm assuming the processor throttles itself in response to the heat, which will cause a noticeable performance drop. There also seems to be random performance drops unrelated to what app's I'm using or how long I've been using the phone. They're rare but when they do occur, they're very noticeable and annoying. Sometimes app icons will disappear and will only reappear when the performance stabilizes. Other times there is a noticeable delay in starting apps after clicking them. I can't really explain how or why it's happening because I've been unable to recreate the issue intentionally other than when playing an intensive game for an hour or more and letting the phone get very hot. BUILD - The phone is beautiful and feels great in the hand. It's not slippery feeling but is very smooth. It feels very solid. I used to worry with my last phone that if I sat down with it in my back pocket, that I'd bend it. I've no concern of that with this phone. CAMERA - The camera's are average at best. They're not terrible. They're not great. The front-facing camera will get the job done for selfie's as long as you have good lighting. The dual-camera setup on the back is is also decent. With proper lighting and a steady hand, you can get some decent pictures. SCREEN - It's not an AMOLED but that's not really an issue for me. The black's aren't as deep or rich of course, but that's an acceptable loss for this price range. The screen does auto-brighten in day light, which makes it a little more easily used outside. My only complaint is that the screen is very, very sensitive to touch. So sensitive in fact that if I'm scrolling through the app drawer and barely touch the edge of an app icon for even a split second, it'll launch. Coming from an iPhone, the sensitivity difference is going to take getting used to.",

                "review_text": "Purchased this phone to replace my father's outdated SS Note 3, and he is quite happy with the upgrade. I've been an iPhone guy since the 3G back in 2008. I have to say this phone has sincerely WOW'd me for the price. I've looked up reviews and knew I was expecting a similar design to my current iPhone 7+, but for $200 I can say the display's quality is similar to my iPhone 7+, the build quality feels similar of an iPhone, the buttons for volume and lock are clicky and satisfying to press and overall better than my iPhone's buttons! (and Honor includes a FREE CLEAR CASE in box vs headphones which has more value to me imo) UMEI is a great skin, it is very iOS-like which felt very familiar out of the box, and great to have the app drawer enabled by default. Seriously the only drawback I can think of is the camera quality, for a dual lens system I was expecting a little more sharpness and color reproduction but I noticed most photos, were lacking in light/color. It gets the job done, but I highly recommend Honor/Huawei to spend the extra $ on their next model and increase the msrp by $20 to include an improved camera module and this would easily replace my iPhone next year. NO NFC so no Android Pay, but my father is very old school and could care less about it, but it could be a dealbreaker for those who frequent contactless payments. But most modern credit/debit cards are going contactless, so there's that. Anyways thanks for creating a great phone for the price Huawei you knocked it out of the park in almost every department in my book.",

So I went out looking for the best bang for the bucks but I didn't want to spend more then $250.. I came to the conclusion that whatever phone I buy at that price range will be a used or refurbished one. A little bit of research had me looking into this bad boy and I was truly amazed at the price point. However, I was worried that being a Chinese brand, the quality would suffer (sorry, this myth no longer holds true to me after purchasing this phone and a TCL smart TV). The final step of deciding to purchase this phone came in comparing what I can get instead for the same price range... Nothing came close after hours of research except the Samsung Galaxy S7.. the difference would be that the Galaxy S7 would cost way more for a brand new phone and a refurbished in most cases would also cost more!! Verdict after 2 Weeks with the phone: Truly amazing and I'm not exaggerating. I am actually constantly looking at the phone amazed that I got it at this price. It feels like I'm easily holding a phone that retails upwards of $400 but I got it for half that. If anyone else is on the fence like I was.. jump right over! the grass really is greener on the Honor 7X side ( =",

Phone looked beautiful but the bezel was too big. Then I saw the honor 7x. I drooled at the features this thing had. I watched videos. Read reviews. Even purposely looked at why you shouldn't buy it the reason weren't enough to make me not want to buy. It came 2-3 days than expected and the box itself looks extremely sexy. The way they have the tape at the bottom so you'll know of someone was in it. Then when it came to opening the box it came off like butter and seeing the phone was an instant nut. It was smooth, had a nice weight, and screen. Mmmamamia it was sleek. When turning it on the UI was amazing. It had an iPhone and Android mix. Forget team Android or iPhone, phone had both. Settings it up was a breeze. Downloading apps. Easy. Then I went to settings to turn on all the cool features. I went straight to looking for the option to expand the screen on any app. I tell you what, with this option my phone looks like any iPhone someone would have. You keep the back of the phone down and nobody would know the difference. This phone is more than awesome especially for only $200. All I have to say is to not download too many apps. It will take up all the Ram and it will start to slow down.",

                "review_text": "I've had this phone over a week now and like it more each day. I had been attached to my HTC One M9 but it had contracted degenerative terminal battery disease; symptoms include spontaneous power off and battery standby of an hour or less. As the disease ran it's inevitable course I knew I had to replace it. Investigation of possible battery transplant offered little hope. The new HTC U11 was way out of my price range also one thing I really wanted was offline FM radio and because wireless companies prefer that you use data it's frequently only on one-off brands and cheap phones. I kept running across the Huawei honor7x. While there are some scathing reviews, there are some scathing reviews for every phone so the percentage of good reviews must be taken into consideration. The screen quality, camera, battery, processor & GPU, my offline FM radio, and Tricorde-resque plethora of sensors, overall build tells me I've made the right decision. Since receiving it Wednesday I've charged it 3 times. I was charging my HTC 3-6 times per day and even that was insufficient. The complaints in the harsher reviews of the Huawei honor7x frequently indicate \"lagging\" but they also say it's resolved by a reboot, \" only to return again at some point in the future. So for a $200 phone with premium features, occasionally one may have to turn it off then on again. THE HORROR!! Others dislike the micro USB vs USB-C. I personally am relieved I don't need to replace my numerous charging cables. Also, complaints about no Qualcomm quick charge. With light to moderate use, the H7X lasts me 3 days between charges. Also, it's 1/4 the price of a premium phone. If they are going to omit something I'm glad it's that. What else? Oh no wireless charging either. While inductive oscillating charging is kinda neat, it's slow, hard on circuitry due to heat and testy, if your device isn't right on the correct spot it doesn't charge so you just put your phone down for a while, which can be a good thing on its own, but it still needs changing. So again, it's$200, and if you feel that strongly about wireless charging you can buy a kit. Personally I think my $200 phone should go to work for me in the morning so I can sleep, keep me sexually gratified and cook my dinner, but that's not what phones do. Conversely, if you are not willing to spend close to $1000 on a phone there are some things that you are going to have to do without. That being said, the H7X isn't really a compromise, you are getting far more for your money in my book! Thank you Huawei! Excellent phone at an excellent value!",

By far the biggest pos I have ever had, and it cost $40 more then the 7x. The new phone is thinner, lighter and easier to use one handed. I'm 6'4' and have pretty big hands. My wife at 5'1\" can also single habdes us the phone. I believe it has to do with the new aspect ratio. Seems taller and thinner than the old ones. Fast, bright and beautiful.

My only gripe is the very very limited selection in cases (it does come with a flimsy clear one) but that's the price you pay for a cheap phone. Really though, nothing about this phone seems cheap.

If you like multitasking however, depending on the apps you are using, you might have some issues with speed. I used a remote desktop app to control numerous computers while on the phone, and noticed significant lagging. However most phones would be much slower under that kind of workload. For the everyday user, this phone is an amazing buy. Do not listen to people when they say that this phone does not take good pictures and video. Out of the box, it is great for pics and vids. There are plenty of apps that can take the camera to higher levels of quality as well. The only thing I do not like about having this phone is.....Huawei does not issue updates quickly or consistently for the US version of this phone. All other versions seem to get updates, but not the United States version. Outside of this small issue, the phone is a must buy for anyone on a budget. Huawei has the potential to take over the US market, provided our government allows them to make deals with the major phone carriers. Go ahead if you are thinking about this......and buy this phone.

Fingerprint sensor is really quick.. Now for the cons; calls don't last more than 15 minutes before it disconnects and I have to recall. It wasn't a big problem, but now calls won't last a minute. I've been experiencing some strange stutter when switching between basic apps. My phone has also randomly crashed about 4-5 times and just rebooted by itself.

I have MetroPCS and they don't always give the best opportunity to get a good deal on a new phone if you already have them so I bought this one from Amazon and figured at $199, I can't really go wrong. The phone has exceeded my expectations in every way so far. The screen is larger than my old phone and it has 4 times the internal memory, the processing speed has had no problem so far. The cameras work great, the graphics are clear, the battery life is amazing. For the price, I really can't complain, also it showed it would not be in stock until the 26th (I ordered on the 24th), instead it ended up shipping the same day I ordered (the afternoon of the 24th) and arrived the next day! So far I'm very pleased with this phone!",

What I didn't know was that the wifi speed is incredibly slow if you simply have Bluetooth enabled. Speed tests put it under 5 mb with bt on, and over 60 with it off. I'm not sure if it's just my unit, but the audio via Bluetooth is really bad. Tested across three devices and it just has a distorted sound through this one. Wired earbuds sound just fine though. All in all, it's a nice, attractive phone for $200, but the poor wifi with bt on, and the audio via bt makes it feel pretty disappointing for my needs.",

                "review_text": "I'm holding off on giving this phone a 5 until I get more time with it, as it just arrived today. If you get blue, be aware it's a darker blue than the picture would suggest. It's more of a navy than a bright blue, but that's fine with me. I haven't tested the wifi as of yet, so I can't verify any claims about how good/bad it is. Pro's and Con's so far: Pros: - Contrary to some things I've been reading, we ordered two of these, one black and one blue, and both are getting 4g service through AT&T, so that hasn't been a problem for us. - The fingerprint sensor is SUPER snappy so far, by far the fastest way to unlock the phone, and to my pleasant surprise you can register up to 5 fingers in the settings, so multiple people can be given permissions to unlock the phone with that option if you so choose, which is incredibly nice. It's also good to note that out of the box the phone has the option to toggle on and off extra functions for that sensor, which lets you answer calls, pull down the notification menu, etc., which is quite convenient. -The phone feels well constructed, and the aluminum body makes it feel stout. It's been in my pocket (with thin rigid case and screen protector) through work and I've stopped worrying for the most part about accidentally cracking the screen. The phone is quite rigid and feels durable. -The camera is great. There's a plethora of features built in with Huawei's software, and it's given me some amazing shots (I'll include at least one with this updated review). It'll take some experimenting to get used to, and it will also take practice to learn what works best when, but overall I'm extremely happy. It won't do 4k or anything that great, but I hardly expected it to. -For a \"cheap\" phone the speakers are more than passable. You won't get amazing depth of sound or anything (these are phone speakers, after all) but audio is clear and loud enough for my uses. - I've yet to get this phone under %50 battery, but I'm not a power user. It's greatest test so far as been as a GPS device for about a 4hr round trip, with the screen on about 3/4 of that time along with my normal light use. Heavy users will likely have more problems with it, but if you manage how many things you have going on in the background it's not a problem. -I cannot complain at all about screen quality here. If anything I'm thoroughly impressed. Colors are true, lines are crisp, and it responds to touch without issue. It looks beautiful. Cons: -The first minor thing is that if you're ordering it for AT&T you might need to mess with some APN settings when you first set it up. It's an inconvenience but nothing serious that other phones don't also have to deal with. -I do have one mildly irritating issue with headphone audio, which honestly is barely worth mentioning. I think it's due to the phone turning off power to audio devices to conserve battery life, but when I have headphones in (and only then), a second or two after audio is stopped there's a squeak or pop. It's the same noise you would hear plugging headphones into the headphone jack or wiggling the wire on a dying pair of headphones to get it to reconnect and play sound. It's slightly irritating, but not enough to dampen my enjoyment of this phone. -Some will consider this a Con, but I don't mind it personally. As of now this phone is still running Android 7.0 Nougat, without an option to upgrade to the newest Oreo software. This is supposed to change, however I haven't found a solid date on when the update will roll out to this device. - The phone does not support USB type C. This doesn't bother me in the least, but some people prefer it for various (legitimate) reasons. Overall, this is an amazing device for the cost, and I can't recommend it enough. It doesn't help that I'm still getting a kick out of showing it to people and seeing the look of shocked disbelief on their faces when I inform them that this sleek, snappy device is a Huawei, which in my area has a reputation for being the bad end of cheap. Holding it up to a friend's Samsung Galaxy Note 8, it's nearly identical in size, and in brief comparison seemed just as high quality, and it's a surprise to people that it's not a flagship phone.",

The phone itself, not so much. Apps don't work properly, seems like they aren't compatible with software. In fact, apps that I had transferred from my old phone that were working fine were incompatible with the honor 7x, affecting the whole operation of this phone. So right after the initial setup I had to do a factory reset, upsetting but the phone was good to go. Then the problems started. Slow. Laggy. Freezing. Shutting down randomly. Kept having to restart which was very frustrating, couldn't even use the phone for a half hour sometimes. I honestly don't understand the rave reviews about the honor 7x!

It supports LTE FDD band 17 (and several other bands), so it should work with AT&T, and NVMO using AT&T network like cricket mobile that I use. I feel that smart phones are quickly commoditized, and it's getting very hard to justify paying for the price the flagship phones ask these days. So this phone is a godsend for me.",

I consider myself to be tech savvy but not a tech snob when it comes to phones. That being said, I know what I'm looking for in a phone and I thought this phone had it. I had been patiently waiting on the Honor View 10 to come out (guess I should've waited a tad bit longer) but decided to bite the bullet and just buy this phone until its release. THE GOOD: Beautiful phone- solid build. Love the aluminum body and how it feels in the hand. Love the skins and themes you can download to customize the phone. Transferring all of my apps / accounts / etc from my previous phone was a breeze and only took about an hour or so. THE BAD: I'm coming from a ZTE Axon Mini 7 which has given me hell with performance issues. Watch Netflix on the Axon 7 Mini is a lot crisper than this phone (sure it has something to do with LCD vs AMOLED). THE UGLY: RAM RAM RAM! Imagine my heartbreak when this phone started to lag not even a week after owning it. Imagine my frustration when I realized there was a Mate SE model with more RAM that was available for $30 more. Needless to say I am in the process of returning the Honor 7X and purchasing the Mate SE. Totally worth the money in my opinion.",

                "review_text": "For $200.00, you can't beat the quality. Especially when you first setup the phone, the phone will be under a great deal of load. It's a no-brainer since your phone is usually installing all of your apps from your previous phone and the corresponding updates for the system as well. Still, even casual use will lock up the phone. This isn't a huge deal. Close your 4 million apps and try performing the same task again, it should work without issue. That being said, as someone who needs to use this phone for IT work, the lock up can be frustrating sometimes. If you're on a budget and you want a little better performance, plop down the extra $30 and go for the 4GB, 64GB version of this phone found here (trust me, I wish I had done the same but it's not worth the effort just yet): Huawei Mate SE Factory Unlocked 5.93\" - 4GB/64GB Octa-core Processor| 16MP + 2MP Dual Camera| Grey (US Warranty) The 5.93\" phone screen is AMAZING. I put it right next to my brother's iPhone X, who by the way had been bragging about his new iPhone X for months, and he went quiet before releasing a subtle \"wow.\" When I told him how much money it cost, he shook his head in disbelief. Screen transitions can be customized, you can add 5x6 app tiles, and the stock backgrounds and lock screens are visually pleasing to look at. Sometimes I find myself waking my phone just to remind myself of how awesome the phone really is. Storage is a bit of a bust. The system takes about half the storage of the phone. If you buy a 32GB, be ready to have about 18GB of storage to actually use. Again, if you're on a budget but you need double the storage, check the link I posted earlier because that is the exact same phone with an extra GB of RAM and an extra 32GB of storage on top of what this phone currently has. My only regret is that I didn't upgrade for $30 to 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage but you can be assured that once you have this phone, you'll forget what a galaxy or iPhone is, or why they even exist.",

It might not have the specs of the iPhone, but it went above my means and more. The camera I've learned to tweak for optimum result, last photo from the 7X. Its fast with 4g from T-Mobile, as well as WIFI. The fingerprint ID is responsive and fast. Battery \ud83d\udd0blife is great, and charges relativly fast.

I've had no serious glitches since received 3/12/18 as other reviews have stated.

The phone is very nice overall, good signal and call quality, no issues with bluetooth, nice, large screen, battery rarely drops to 50% at night.

                "review_text": "I have always used iPhones and bought this just to try out an Android phone. My previous phone was an iPhone 6s. I have been using it for my main phone for a couple of days and I really like it. Pros: Screen - The 18:9 screen is big and easy to use. The text is much sharper than on my iPhone (407 ppi vs 326 ppi on my iPhone). The viewing angles are a bit worse than my iPhone, but not by much. The display gets just as bright as my iPhone. Batery life: It lasts quite a bit longer than my iPhone. Build quality: The phone feels like it cost way more than $200, however the matte black version is like a fingerprint magnet. Buttons: The power and volume buttons feel solid and not mushy. Fingerprint scanner: The fingerprint scanner is so fast and accurate. Opens in less than half a second. Much faster than Touch ID gen 2. Call quality: The sound from the earpiece is load and clear. Camera: The secondary 2MP camera for wide aperture mode does not do such a good job at blurring out the background, however the primary sensor can capture very nice images on its own, especially closeups. Cons: WiFi and Bluetooth issue: When bluetooth is on Wifi speed drops significantly. This is because they share the same antenna, but I was still able to play 1080p YT videos to a bluetooth speaker, for $200 I can't really complain. Main Speaker: It lacks mid and bass frequency and can easily be covered. My iPhones speaker was much better. No 4k recording: This is due to a chipset limitation. MicoUSB: At least you don't have to buy a bunch of new cables if you have a lot of microUSB cables. No fast chrging: It charges as fast as my iPhone with the 1 amp charger. --- After looking at my iPhone after using this, my iPhone just seems so ancient.",

                "review_text": "I've had this phone for a little over 2 months and up until this last week I was thrilled with it. The body design is sleek and looks on par with bigger brand phones, and the interface had all the customization I love with androids as well as being user friendly and streamlined like apple products. It was a little glitchy or laggy with some higher memory usage apps like Snapchat and it doesn't do \"fast charging\" like the bigger brand phones do now, but overall I was over the moon with the performance and design of this phone for the price. However, in the last week when I plug it in to charge I've been noticing it either isn't charging all the way or it seems like the charge has decreased. I thought maybe I was unplugging it without thinking about it and then forgetting to plug it back in. But today it has almost completely stopped charging. I've tried 4 different chargers, including the one it came with, and it does not even acknowledge being plugged in. I gave it 3 stars because while it took a charge, it was an awesome phone for the price. However, 2 months is a very short phone life. So if you're looking for a high quality-for-the-price phone for a short period of time, this phone would probably be perfect for you. But if you're looking for a phone to last and perform consistently for a long period of time, it's probably best to shell out a little more cash for higher quality.",

                "review_text": "Update (4 days later after purchase) Unfortunately, I had to drop 2 stars after using the phone for 4 days. I started to hit serious lag. It seems like reviews you may find on youtube are reviewing the 4GB/64GB international version, because the US version with the 3GB/32GB is just not on par with the international version. Why I dropped 2 stars? - No 5ghz wifi connectivity. This is a serious bummer, since I only connect to the 5ghz frequency on my home wifi, since I had problems with other devices connecting and my wifi router routinely dropping some off the wifi-list,unless it's on the 5ghz freq. This is kinda interesting, since as far as I can remember, even phones from 2014 had ac 5ghz option. - Extremely slow charging. I just can't get around with this. I can see people charging their phones at night, but there are phones out now with the same $200+ price range that do fast charging. Micro USB is one thing, there are phones that fast-charge with it, but again, we are in 2018. - No NFC. Granted, there are only a few budget phones with NFC, but we need to look at from the point of view of the year 2018 just began and within a few months, more budget phones are coming out, packed with more features than ever before, even with NFC. Let this be the least of the problems, it's a compromise that most people can live with, if they don't use NFC (not using their phones with Google Play or transfer files etc. ) - Here is the worst. After several days, the phone began to lag. Whether it's from the new update, that popped up during setup, whether it's something to do with lesser memory than most phones or the interface itself, I don't know. I ended up disabling apps to gain some speed back, including disabling amazon apps, navigation apps and the built in Huawei apps. Then it continued. Browsing a webpage is like the scrolling acceleration is disabled or just the lag gets worse. Keep shutting down recently used apps won't help. Rebooting won't help, there is a constant lag while browsing in Chrome and in Facebook, something I don't experience in other budget phones for years now. Hopefully Huawei can address this in future updates, or could be just a few particular models effected, I don't know. It can get very annoying. There is something going on with the memory management, whatever, I am not an expert, but it just ruins the experience. Speaker is ok, but still very tiny sound. Again, we are talking about a $200 phone, but consider the trade-offs. In a nutshell, here is what to keep an eye out for when purchasing this phone: +Nice bright screen, small bezels, +Good camera for the price +notification LED (many people prefer it) +battery lasts a day for most people +fingerprint reader is lightning fast +Love/Hate heavy launcher skin over Android OS --------------------------------------------------------------- - Lag can creep up after a certain amount time, restart needed, apps needs to be disabled, /wait for more updates?/ - Still on Android Nougat, no confirmed date for Oreo update - Heavy launcher skin over Android OS - No dual band wifi -No NFC -US version : 3GB RAM/32GB of onboard space -Micro USB -No fast charging -No 4K recording capability -No image stabilization -tiny single speaker at the bottom ---------------------------------- At this point, I had luck to use the Honor 6X for 2 weeks last year and it was great. I would recommend that phone over this one.",

I had it Forever. But the Crack in the screen and slow lagging on this phone was starting to get to me. So was researching some phones that were 400 bucks and under. Based on lots of online reviews on YouTube and Google and of course here. I decided to try this phone. It is awesome. I love how it's android and also like the iphone. Pretty neat. I know it doesn't charge quickly but neither did my old phone so I'm ok with that. I'm not a power user. Just mostly for texting, phone and occasional social media, news etc. This is a great phone blows my old note 3 phone away. **Also read on many blogs and news media that the honor 7x will be one of the lucky phones to get the new oreo update very soon** Can't wait for that! This phone just keeps getting better each day. I'm really loving it. And at this price, can't beat it!",

Nothing beats the note 7 before it was bricked though. I am really impressed with the phone for several reasons. PRO: The phone construction is great, camera is better than expected for a low level phone (about the same as the S5, but not as good as the Note7 or V20 and better than the others listed above), button feel is perfect, color is as advertised, screen looks good and the brightness level is way better than expected and much brighter than my Moto G4, speaker volume is very loud, but tonaly quality isn't that great but not as bad as others I have had. I really like the overlay of the gui and the options for customization are close to flagship level and equal or better than other big brands I have had. Response time of the processor is good and not a let down, the 3 gig ram seems fine for the phone also. Battery life is great and closely 30% longer lasting than the G4 I still have. The real surprise is the fingerprint sensor and how well it perfectly and instantly recognises several programed fingers. The Note7 was a joke in comparison . CONS: What I dislike is the fact the touch screen anywhere around the edges is kinda iffy, not really responsive at all. Using it as a hotspot is worthless as the speed is a joke and not even capable of playing youtube vids at a 240p setting. I still have 2 other working phones for a direct network comparo and this phone just sucks for use as a hotspot. My only SLIGHTLY MINOR COMPLAINT, is that this thing is slippery! lol Good thing they included the slim fitting, great quality cover/case for it. Given the battery life the last complaint is that it isn't a fast charging phone at all, but being that it needs charged less often that other phones I can still get a 12.5hr work day out of it before it dies. I have not charged it for 2 days on my days off, so the battery life is great in general, but having the turbo charge that other phones offer is still lacking on this phone. Again, just a minor con. Overall: I really like it and would buy it again if needed, but the lack of it being a hotspot is a big issue for me, as I used my last 2 phones a lot for this as my home wifi blows in some rooms and could use the phone to stream through the pc, smart tv, and the roku with ease for netflix movies. This phone just completely fails in that regard. Because of this I am wanting to give it 3 stars, but as it works so well in all other areas I will gift it an extra star and give it a 4.",

I was just listening to spotify, heard a notification go off, so I tried to unlock screen to view my message. The screen wouldn't cut on. I pressed the power button a few more times, eventually it cut on for a brief second and then just cut off again. I figured it was just being slow, so I opted to restart the phone. When the phone turned on, it constantly goes to the EMUI eRecovery page, which always fails to update to fix my phone. As of now, my phone is bricked and unusable. I've heard that flashing the stock firmware might work? I don't know much about that stuff, but from what I understand, Huawei doesn't normally make their stock firmware public for months after release and I cannot go months without a phone due to the nature of my work. I essentially just have a $200 paperweight now. --OLD REVIEW-- Absolutely love it. Phone lasts 3-4 days with light usage, day and a half with constant usage(Such as hours and hours of Netflix, or some light gaming) Only reason it isn't a 5-star, isn't necessarily a fault of the 7x, it's more-so a feature of theirs that doesn't like to work with Android well. The 18:9 screen, while excellent, imo, for viewing pleasures, the screen sometimes acts a little weird and doesn't register me pressing a button, so I have to double tap every once in a while. Not a huge problem, imo, however. I can live with that, overall, I love the phone.",

Then when it says you need to download the message it will fail. It has restarted a few times. I also have a video of it locking up or bottle necking. This was out of a lock screen nothing was running in the back ground. I could understand if it was over loaded. It does not like nova launcher. There's a lot to like and a lot to dislike. Everything is up to date on the phone. I just think i might have not hit the silicone lottery with this one and the CPU in mine just isn't up to pair with the rest of the honor 7x's. I'll give it until over the weekend and see if i can work out the quarks if not i'm going to send it back. I want it to be a good phone.",

Split screen functionality is super useful. Fingerprint sensor works perfectly. Build quality feels amazing. Metal body feels like a much more expensive phone. Super slim What I don't like: The speaker is terrible. I had read other reviews that mentioned this and thought nothing of it, but it's really tinny sounding, no bass at all. It's a bigger deal than I thought it would be. There are no great screen protectors for this phone! Not sure why. Best I've found so far is a skinomi TechSkin. The only other issues are the sorts of things you expect on a $200 phone. No USB-C No fast charging Not as much RAM as I'd like Etc. As I said no real issues yet, just budget level everything. CONCLUSION: Great phone for the price. Probably the best sub $500 phone available.",

After trying two att carriers h2o and straight talk and multiple days of tech support for each no one knows what's causing calls to be missed, calls straight to voicemail and delayed text messages. On top of this having Bluetooth on significantly slows wifi speeds. Unfortunately I cannot return the phone to Amazon. Update: Was able to get phone returned to Amazon for a partial refund. I was given a bit of a runaround but it worked out after a few hours on the phone and on chat. Topping off the bad experience was Honor stating that the defect fell under a non covered article of their limited warranty.",

                "review_text": "My first impression of this phone was that it\u2019s a great phone which rival\u2019s phones that cost double its price. Both the build quality and display are premium. Initially, I was a little worried about purchasing a phone with something other than stock Android on it since that\u2019s what my previous phone (a Nexus 5x) was running, but the EMUI interface isn\u2019t bad at all and I didn\u2019t consider it a downgrade once I used it. The Honor 7x ships with a little bloatware installed, most of which can be removed. Some apps such as SwiftKey cannot be uninstalled, although you can set the default to the Google keyboard app instead. The phone also ships with a clear case that\u2019s good enough to use until you know you\u2019re going to keep the phone. I spent almost an entire day getting everything setup only to later discover that the Honor 7x is not compatible with Fitbit devices. It will not sync no matter what and searching for the problem reveals that everyone else with this phone is experiencing the same problem. I'm not sure if it\u2019s a problem with the phone or Fitbit. Based on my research, both the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi share the same antenna on this phone. Anytime the phone is restarted, the Bluetooth is automatically disabled and has to be re-enabled. Pros include a beautiful and large screen with small bezels, great performance, and premium build quality. Cons include no NFC (used for mobile payments), no 5G Wi-Fi support, and Micro-USB instead of USB-C. Sadly, I had to return the phone due to a lack of compatibility with my Fitbit Charge 2. My recommendation to anyone purchasing this phone is to test it with your Bluetooth devices before investing a significant amount of time configuring everything else.",

This is my first android phone in 5 years so here are my comments: The build quality is very good, screen looks very good (except in direct sunlight), the fingerprint scanner is super quick. I have quite a few games on my phone, the only one that lags at all is the simpsons tapped out. The phone came with a really nice slim clear phone case which is awesome. Camera is decent, phone is fast, EMUI (Huawei's android skin) is cool for me and easy to customize....basically for $200, you can't beat the quality of this phone. Now on to my complaints. The 32 GB isn't enough for me, so I bought a 32GB SD card in the 2nd SIM slot for my music. I uploaded all my music to google Play Music from itunes which wasn't too difficult. The somewhat annoying part was that you have to go into the settings on Play Music to have the music download directly to the SD card, as the storage management doesn't let you transfer between your internal drive and SD card. The only thing I've been able to download directly to the SD card is music and photos. I haven't been able to find out how to transfer apps to the SD card, which is somewhat frustrating as it shouldn't be that hard to figure out. The SD Card/Internal drive storage management and lack of NFC are my only real complaints about the phone, and the only reason I can't give the phone 5 stars.",

                "review_text": "Update: changing to 2 stars after weeks of use for two reasons: Screen: touch screen very non responsive. If you swipe down from top of the screen to access settings menu it would work 7 out of 10 times, the other 3 times it either does not respond at all or swipes right back up. Very erratic behavior when surfing websites (many accidental likes on Facebook when I am no where near the like button on the touchscreen). Typing numbers take many tries especially the numbers on the edges. After sale support: abysmal. I talked to honor about the issue above and their response: send in the phone, we will take 2 weeks besides shipping time to look into whether we can fix this or not. From a (former) hardcore Honor fan: you blew it this time. This will be my last Honor device. Honor 5x started the tradition of true \u201cbudget\u201d smart phones with a metal design and a fingerprint sensor which were rarely seen on any phone with close price tag at that time. This was followed with Honor 6x which was a huge hit and changed the expectation for any phone with similar price range. You no longer must settle for cheap plastic or one hour screen on time battery. Honor 6x was a definitive improvement over the honor 5x, and I gave it 5 stars on my review when it was first released about a year ago. Honor is doing it again! In lines with the same tradition, Honor 7x is yet another \u201cbudget-premium\u201d phone with contemporary design and low-price tag. How does it compare to its predecessor? Un-boxing and accessories Honor still going with the standard (almost identical) box. Nothing fancy. Like always, it is much easier to find accessories for the older phone but this is unlikely to last long. One major difference: Honor decided to oddly enough skip the preinstalled screen protector it had installed on Honor 6x. Being a new phone with no widespread accessories (no screen protector available even on their own web store!) coupled with a lack of oleophobic coating makes this a weird department to cut costs. They still included a standard clear plastic case but this was a bummer. Off to a bumpy start! Design Perfect! Whatever honor is doing, they should keep it up. The design has progressed over time and while Honor 6x was gorgeous, I liked the longer body and curved corners on this one. And that blue shade is something you find on an 800+ phone. Some may not like the two camera bumps on the back but to me the phone is much more than you can ask for in this price range. Just look at it next to G5 plus and you will see the difference! Processor, RAM and performance Honor 5x had the more widely known Snapdragon 617, while Honor 6x had Kirin 655. Honor 7x is using the next in line Kirin 659. Performance continues to be adequate for everyday use. You will not notice a significant difference coming from Honor 6x, but my last device before this was Mate 9 and the difference is noticeable. Compared to how Honor 6x felt when it was first released, 7x feels slower. I feel that the 659 is more shifted towards saving battery life. It is not for power users, but should be fine for everyone else! Despite having more RAM, it does not seem to be able to handle more apps at the same time in the background compared to 6x. Overall it does not feel like an upgrade over the 6x. Screen Screen is adequate as well, but it also does not feel like an upgrade over the 6x. colors are less saturated, and apps do not yet take advantage of the extra length. Auto brightness seems to struggle more than that of 6x. Touch control also is not as accurate as 6x. Occasionally the touchscreen did not respond to my down swipe and I had to try a few times to get the settings bar down. It can get frustrating at times. Camera a Major update over 6x. Honor seems to have mastered the budget two camera settings and this combination is really working for me. Pictures are on bar with any above average phone camera. They are not pixel or note 8 quality but they are much better than 6x. Software EMUI 5 is still the same. Performance is good in general with a few annoying quirks. It was disappointing to have it with Android 7 but Honor did follow through on their promises when it comes to updates in the past so let\u2019s hope Android 8 is not delayed for much longer. Meanwhile EMUI 5.1 is still very acceptable, much lighter than most other skin but far away from pure android. Battery The main reason I spent 2 out of the last 3 years with an Honor device as my main driver is the battery. Like I said in my 6x review, it will not last 2 days, 3 days or longer. You will not get 10 hours of screen on time. But again, that is not what I am looking for in a phone. I am looking for a phone that can give me few hours (3-5 at least of screen on time) to check my emails and browse internet, may be the occasional game or two, and not drain itself to death when I am not using it. I do not get good reception in my work area where I spend several hours a day and this seems to suck the life out of every battery I tried, so my phone would go from 100 in the morning to 40 or so while not being used but rarely. Not any more with Honor 5x, 6x and now 7x. I am still able to go home with 50 \u2013 60% + with moderate usage and 2-3 hours screen on time. Again, It lacks true quick charging but it charged to 100% in about two hours (Same for 6x). Bravo honor! Miscellaneous Fingerprint scanner is still exceptional. It is by far the fastest I have ever used and rarely fails. It is fully compatible with T mobile and AT and T just like 6x and LTE is still excellent: I get around 10-15 mg download speed in a major metro area on both T mobile and ATT It does have double sim, the second sim doubles as an SD card slot in both Still using USB 2 for a charger. To me this is a plus. I have 10+ USB 2 chargers around my house and do not intend to buy another 10 chargers unless I have to. Verdict This is an excellent phone but it does not feel like an overall update over 6x. 6x seems to be performing a touch better, \u201cusable\u201d screen area is essentially the same, battery seems to be the same, fingerprint scanners and software is the same. 7x on the other hand looks better and has a far better camera. They are both going for $200 on amazon so you will not go wrong with either. Personally, I cannot imagine why would I pay $600-800 in a phone. You are definitely not getting 3-4 times the value with those phones. For everyday use, you cannot ask for better.",

If you manually turn up the brightness, it is completely visible in direct sunlight. I would say to any prospective buyers, do some things to help yourself. The stock launcher has a setting to close apps as you lock the phone. Adjust ones you frequently use to stay open. I found that making them reload from the disk vs RAM makes a big difference with commonly used apps. Make sure to use a sd card and set it as the default storage location.

The camera is slightly better than the Pro 3, and the feel is also a little better. The UI reminds me of Nova Launcher, it is quick, has enough geek tweaks to keep me occupied for a while. I like this phone so much that I parked my Galaxy S7. The one big deal so far for me has been the slow motion movie, it is subpar, it seems to drop a couple of f stops (depending on how you view f stops) the images got super dark when I chose slow motion and the software did not recognize the beginning set point. I will reconsider if i want to take a star away for that, i will see if there is an App to address that issue ( another reason I love androids, there is generally an alternative to solve a problem). I will update after using this while out with friends and family, but there is no way I am parting with this phone even with it's slight shortcoming.",

I do not require or want the new flagship device as I just do not use a phone enough to justify $1K on a phone but I wanted a good looking phone. I am happy to repot this phone looks like a very expensive phone! The huge 18:9 screen just shouts expensive! I needed a good camera, I needed a minimum of 32 gb and a minimum 3 gb ram so this 7x delivers. On my 1st day of using my phone \"more than normal\" as its new, I am at 57% at the end of the evening so looks like the battery life will be great for my normal use and will give me much more than a full day. UPDATE: I have now had the phone a few weeks and with my light to average use ( I do not live on my phone) I noticed I was on day 3, 8 hours and still had a little battery left! So I know with how I use my phone, I will never be searching for a charger! I am on t-mobil and happy to report the phone works well ( my other phones did not as I am in a bad t-mobil location) The voice over 4G does work and the voice quality is MUCH better than any phone I have used. T-Mobil WiFi calling does not work with this phone. I have been using T-Mobil purchased phones with T-Mobil versions of Android and or iPhones but T-Mobil WIFI calling only works on iPhones and T-Mobil devices. After searching T-mobil does have a App ( T-Mobil DIGITS) That allows calling / texting via a internet connection so I expect the WIFI calling will be a non-issue for me. I did use WIFI calling the few times I vacation in the mountains with no cell signal but now that I have a Digits app I'm okay. This phone wifi will only do 2.4 ghz, not 5.0 ghz but I have improved my home wifi with a mesh system and I find most hotspots around town use the 2.4. My phone is very fast however when I do a wifi speed test I do not get the speed I do with a 5.0 ghz phone but the 7X phone is actually a faster phone? I would like to see dual band WIFI and I considered another brand because of only 2.4 but the other brand at this price point did not have this beautiful screen size so I am very happy I purchased this phone. When purchasing this phone I also wanted a case and a glass screen protector, These Amazon products fit PERFECT and love them as much as the phone! Huawei Honor 7X case, Yuanling [Shock Resistant] Carbon Fiber Soft TPU Brushed Texture Phone case Anti-fingerprint Flexible Full-body Protective Cover For Huawei Honor 7X smartphone (Blue) This glass protector fits PERFECT with no bubbles and went on EZ, Best glass protector I have ever used so if you are buying the 7x, this is the one to buy! [2 Pack]Huawei Honor 7X Screen Protector,Setber [Full Coverage][2.5D Arc Edges][9 Hardness][Anti-Scratch][Anti-fingerprint][HD Clear]Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Huawei Honor 7X -Blue At this price point , My thoughts are with this grade of camera, battery life, edge to edge 18:9 screen ( makes phones with normal screens look ancient ) and the fact that it is reported the 7X will get the newest Android 8.0 Oreo, this phone is simply the phone to buy!",

                "review_text": "I've had this phone for a week now and love it so far. The phone feels very solid and has a beautiful display. The fingerprint sensor on the back has worked flawlessly and it is so nice to be able to turn a phone on with just a finger touch on the back. It is blazing fast and has performed flawlessly. My son who purchased the Note 8 said he would have purchased this phone had it seen it before buying the Note. This is an exceptional phone for the money. UPDATE: After using this phone for a couple of months I still feel this is by far the best phone for the price. I've noted that it periodically needs to be rebooted. I've also had some issues with the camera responding very slowly. I checked last night and I was low on storage which may have been causing the problem with the camera. I deleted some files and apps and I will see if that fixes the camera slowness. I put a simple Spigen case on the phone and have since dropped it twice. It has sustained no damage whatsoever. It easily has enough charge for the day. I use it with a Samsung watch and so it advises me that the Samsung app is consuming a lot of power, but I have never run out. I did notice some hesitation at times when using the browser or apps. After researching the issue I found that the phone only has one antennae for both wireless and bluetooth. I turn off bluetooth when I'm not using it and that alleviates the problem. One antennae is the price of a higher end phone at a low price. Everybody I have showed the phone to has been impressed with its solid feel and nice screen. I was disappointed to see a big box store drop the Huawei line. I believe it is under pressure from other phone makers that want to keep the price elevated. Again, if you want a really good phone at an affordable price - this is the phone for you.",

To be honest the phone feels like a real true premium build quality. The interface runs smooth and have no issues so far. I bought my wife the Honor 6x for Christmas and was really surprised by the look and feel and it\u2019s performance. So I waited for the Honor 7 to be released and so I got one. To be honest these are great quality phones. I use to be in a jump program with Tmobile where I traded in my device up 2 times a year, but I paid $150 a month for 2 phones lines and the ability to do this. I\u2019ve had all the Samsung Notes, and one I phone 7 plus (I hated). So I know what a quality of phone experience is. Since Tmobile made made it\u2019s jump customers start paying $150-$250 down to upgrade I jumped ship and went to Metro PCS and bought my phones outright. I originally bought a Moto G5 Plus w/ Amazon bloatware which ran fine, and no issues. I wanted a premium feel phone. I believe I got that in this Honor 7x. Don\u2019t worry about the Government and the public ridicule of Huawei. They\u2019ve been here for a long time in the US, also selling phones around the globe )3rd largest phone manufacture in the world). I phones and Galaxy phones are also built in China. As long as it\u2019s a quality build I have no problem buying it. I rather pay $200 than $800-$1100. I\u2019m looking forward to next year\u2019s Honor 8x. Hopefully they\u2019ll have 5ghz wifi in an update or in next years model.",

I was looking for a phone that would do everything well for someone who does not game heavily on the phone and does not really require a high end chip set. The build quality of the phone is excellent with a beautiful screen and well laid out buttons and fingerprint sensor. The phone looks like a $800 phone. The performance of the phone is fine with no issues after two weeks of use. There is no lag when switching screens and the camera works quickly producing very nice images. Not sure I am in love with the 18:9 screen ratio. The screen seems slightly narrow for typing but it does help The bottom line is that is this phone represents the best value in the smartphone market today and it rivals the performance of phones costing $400. You are certainly giving up performance and speed when comparing it to more expensive phones. You could buy 4 of these phones or 1 Apple or Samsung phone. And those phones are NOT four times better than this phone. The raw processing speed maybe that much better...but not the rest of the phone. If your looking for a good smartphone that looks great....this is it. And your not going to be crushed if something happens to it.",

I use it constantly, often browsing or playing a game while listening to audiobooks or music, and I have to remind myself to go ahead and charge it every few days, even though it rarely gets below 50%. I've also dropped it dozens of times without any issue. Calls are crystal clear. External speaker is great, I had actually bought an Anker Bluetooth speaker, but returned it, because (at least for audiobooks) I preferred the phone speaker. Love the large screen too.

Screen size is what WE like, we are both around 6 feet tall and have zero problems with the 6\" screens though this is just under that.

And I can't afford to be buying a LG or Samsung and still love myself. I have a Samsung tablet so what am I saying... Hah! Love it.

I have everything installed and a few additional Apps, I have Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Fitbit, Banking apps, Amazon, Ebay and the list goes on and on. NOT one moment of lagging!!!

As far as the no NFC or Quick Charge. That was not a huge deal breaker for me. I never use NFC and this battery with heavy usage keeps up. It charges fast enough for me, honestly if I charge it at about 30% it only takes 30 mins. That is pretty fast. Really the only thing that may be a deal breaker is that it is not very loud if you have hearing problems. One speaker at the bottom. Again not a deal breaker for me. I usually use a Bluetooth speaker and actually prefer that. It is loud enough for me when I receive calls. I honestly would recommend this phone to anyone. It works great on Cricket, My carrier. Do not wait to get this phone. Save your money and get this awesome phone!!!",

The bad- if you are coming from a flagship device from 2016 or 2017 the camera could be better (but for 200 dollars it's very good). Also, the lack of 5ghz WiFi is a let down.

I will admit, i honestly did not even look at this spec when i was researching the phone, but it virtually cripples the phone. I live in an apartment building in downtown Austin, the phone is completely unusable when on Wifi. 2G Wifi works fine if there is not a lot of wifi signals around you, but in an urban setting with routers everywhere, it is so slow i can't even load google without waiting for a minute. Email doesn't work, pages don't load, app store is unusable....just forget about it. As soon as i turn Wifi off it springs to life, but unfortunately without the wifi i can't install updates, or install many apps, or do anything useful really without crippling my data plan.

                "review_text": "This is an update to my original review. It's middle of March and I'm still in love with this phone. My latest project is using it as an alternative to an Oculus Rift. The phone's gyro got turned on in February in an update and that got me to thinking, \"could I do VR with a $200 phone?\". I play Elite Dangerous and while the game is definitely a processor hog it's not too bad on my oldish PC with a fairly old graphics card. So could I attach a VR rig to this and have it work ok? I'm not going to spring for an Oculus just to find out, but maybe the 7X could help me. So I downloaded Kinoni VR which streams video from the PC and the KinoVR app for Android and that gave me the video connection between my PC and the phone. I downloaded FaceTrackNoIR to take the gyro data from Kinoni and put it in a form that Steam/ED understands and then turn on side by side VR in the ED graphics driver and holy crap it works. Top tip, turn off Bluetooth while you're doing this because the 7x doesn't have 5GHz but with BT off 2.4GHZ works fine. I ordered an ETVR head mount from Amazon for $39 because it's good quality and it has integrated headphones and the net result is that I have a pretty good wireless VR rig that I can play my favourite game on. When I'm finished I slip the 7x out of the headset, turn on BT for my watch and the 7x reverts to being my daily driver. All for $200. Now explain to me again why I need the IPhone 10? Jan 2018. This is a wonderful phone. It's my second Huawei device (GX8) and I really appreciate everything about this phone. Basically you can boil down every review into; It runs and feels like a flagship phone except the 3D gaming performance is a bit average. That's it. If you don't play high end 3D games on your phone (Why would you, that's what a PC is for.) Then the Huawei Honor 7X is all the phone you will want. Especially if you slap in a 64GB SD card. BTW I really like the EMUI enhancements. It's kinda like Android plus. Mines black with a black Niilkin slim case, very cool and stealthy. For $200 it's absolutely ridiculous. Watch the reviews, they struggle to find bad things to say. This phone is an embarrassment to Samsung and Apple.",

I've had an iPhone and Samsung in the past and all smartphones have their up's & downs. This being my first Huawei I was a little skeptical however the reviews provided me some encouragement. I really like the design and although not as wide as my LG, it still fit in my leather phone case, which is a personal \"perk' for me. Setup was a cinch. The device instructions are EASY to understand. It took a while since I had a ton of information to move over (12g) but when the process was all done, the two phones practically mirrored one another. All my contacts, photos, etc were there. Fast! Did I mention fast?! A big difference from my LG, which I have no complaints over other than when the memory capped, it was DONE. The Huawei is the most programmable phone I've had. You can set your preference on just about anything. My one negative on this and it may be operator error, is I can't seem to figure out how to set an individual text-tone. Ringtones, yes, but texting.....? The Huawei has an \"easy eye\" feature that blocks out the blue light for easy reading. Wonderful addition! So much so that my wife, having a history of Migraines, purchased her own Huawei and it's on the way. This feature and the matte screen protector, I purchased, reduces the glare considerably. Another added feature I like is the dual sim. With this option I will be able to purchase a prepaid SIM card for when we travel outside of the U.S. on our vacations. No more adding the international plan or buying a cheap burn-phone when I get off the plane. This phone has a dual camera function and, for me, it takes great pics. I'm not a photographer so as long as what I snap is clear, I'm good. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend the Honor 7 to anyone.",

                "review_text": "After years of running mainstream phones (iphone, Samsung, HTC, LG), I believe I can say \"never again\". I've only been using the 7X for a couple of weeks, but it's my new favorite. Apparently I'm not alone because my phone was back-ordered for a week or two. So far, it's been worth the wait. The phone looks and feels like a much more expensive phone. I don't do a lot of gaming, but everything I've done has worked well. If you are coming from a phone that uses a micro-SIM, you'll need to get a new SIM from your network vendor as this phone only takes a nano-Sim, but that was my only (brief) hangup. UPDATE(3/18/18): I'm still a fan of the phone, but one characteristic that could be troublesome for some buyers is the WiFi performance. First, it only supports 2.4Ghz wifi. This shouldn't be too big a deal, by itself. Secondly, the WiFi antenna is shared with the Bluetooth radio. This causes a significant decrease in WiFi performance when using Bluetooth. For instance, in my house, with Bluetooth turned off, I get speeds in the 22-25Mbps range (download). If I turn on the Bluetooth and connect my headset, that will drop to around 15-18Mbps. If I start my podcast player, so I'm actually listening to content via Bluetooth, it drops further, to the 3-7Mbps range. Since most of my content consumption is pre-downloaded content (podcasts, mostly), this doesn't affect me much, and I had not noticed until someone else with the phone (actually a nearly identical Mate SE) mentioned it, and I did my own testing.",

                "review_text": "It is a great product for the price with a major flaw. When you are simultaneously using Bluetooth and Wifi, the wifi speed is crippled (~1Mbps) - which makes watching any streaming service almost impossible above 144p (Again If you turn off bluetooth the wifi speed jumps back to 20Mbps on the same router). Surprisingly it is not a problem when using LTE + bluetooth, where speeds are great over Tmobile (no VoLTE? - it was automatic on Nokia 6). Some people mentioned slowdown but more towards 10Mbps range on wifi + bluetooth (i would have been totally happy with that). I tested it on a google wifi router. Otherwise the phone is fantastic. Great ergonomics, reasonably fast, good battery life, great screen with color temperature adjustments (although like my vizio tv in very dark scenes it has this gray banding - but it is 200$). The build quality is close to iphone 7. The dual sim feature (unlike in the nokia 6) is useless here in the US as it is not simultaneous 3G/4G (there is no 2G service for calls here any way). The camera is definitely better than the nokia 6 and other 200$ android phones. No NFC, No Fast Charging and micro USB (Again all forgivable for 200$), If not for that single flaw it would be a 5 star easily. If bluetooth + wifi is not important for you, i dont think there is a phone under 400$ that can match it. PS: I had to RMA the phone as i was close to the 15 day return window. looks like the issue is again spotty from the comments below. https://forums.androidcentral.com/honor-7x/857396-extremely-slow-wi-fi-usa-model-7x.html There are few more threads.

                "review_text": "I've had this phone for a few months. Ordered it off of the hihonor website because it was back-ordered here. Since my Nexus 5x had bootlooped I couldn't wait a week+ for it to get here. Here is my review: Performance 7/10 ------------------ Does 90% of what I need it to when I need it. I am by no means a power user, I have no social media apps on my phone and use it to mostly check the news, navigate, and make calls. Biggest gripes is the occasional hang up on apps, where it will not load data when I tell it to. For example, sometimes I'll click on a link and nothing will happen. It's not an app problem, but a problem with the phone. Phone gets really bogged down if you are trying to run multiple apps at once (ie phone navigation, listening to an audiobook over bluetooth, checking messages). As many others have mentioned the camera is VERY slow. I am not exaggerating when I say it takes 10-15 seconds for the app to fully fire up and allow you to take pictures. Don't expect to capture any kodak moments with this phone. Interface/OS 8/10 ------------ I didn't really like EMUI, so I downloaded the nova launcher. A lot more slick. After making that change early on, I'm still waiting on the EMUI 8 update which I have yet to get. However, I am not going to complain much for a phone that does what I need it to do. Price 10/10 -------- Probably best bang for your buck even after the complaints to performance. Will make calls when I need to and call quality is good. That should be most of the reason you need this phone. Uses google maps just fine and I have few problems running any single app. Not having a USB-C doesn't bother me, as most of my other devices are still the old USB standard. It's nice to be able to travel and use one type of cord for my PS4 controller, phone, and tablet again. I've never been caught in a bind because my phone takes 2 hours to fully charge instead of one. . . Final Thoughts: I am not feeding into the phone consumerism nonsense, where it is now the norm to spend $600-1000 on a phone every 2-3 years. I hope Huawei can stick to releasing quality phones for under $400 in the U.S. I plan on using them for as long as I can.",

Honor 7x has as good of cameras as I've seen in this price range. I've had a couple of $180 phones (ZTE Blade X Max and LG Stylo 3), and the camera quality between those cameras and Honor 7x is night and day. Pictures are brighter, clearer, and less likely to blur when there is movement. Camera quality is very important to me, which is why I love this phone so much. The operation is decent. With my previous midrange-price phones, getting texts to go through was sometimes hit or miss. I haven't missed any texts or calls, so I am VERY happy about that. As far as app operation goes... games can be a *bit* slow at times, but I've had zero issue with video or audio streaming. Battery life could be much better. It's slow to charge, thanks to the fact the charger is connected to micro USB instead of USB-c, and it drains more quickly than other cameras I've had in the same price range. Conclusion: You'll get your calls and texts perfectly, your pics will look great for the price you paid, but you're gonna want an external battery if you're out at about all day.",

The navigation buttons feel unresponsive and often don't listen to your input. The camera takes a good few seconds to actually open up, and I'd you're stuck in the wrong orientation, flipping it around from selfie to front facing will take yet another few seconds. By that point, the opportunity is lost or your friends are fed up with you and your phone. Flipping between apps by double tapping the square is always a clunky, rugged transition, with animations skipping several frames. Switching between keyboard languages is also clunky and slow-to-load. Coming from an iPhone digital keyboard, the auto complete is a huge step back. Misspelling a word, having it auto complete to a correctly spelled word, but it's not quite the word you're looking for, so you backspace to tweak it a bit, only to have the word revert to the original misspelled word, is way more frustrating than I thought it could ever be. These all seem like minor annoyances. They are. But when they're all working in unison it makes for a very frustrating experience.",

                "review_text": "Update/Edit: After the number of issues I've had with this phone I decided to do even more research on it, including checking benchmark scores. I wish I had done that first! This phone scores abysmally! Yes, it's a $200 phone and should not perform as well as a $500 phone... but keep in mind that you're taking a HUGE performance hit. (About 1/3 to 1/5 as fast as phones in the 400-500 dollar range.) If you have all the time in the world and don't care about performance of your phone or how long it takes to open apps, particularly the camera, then go ahead and waste your money on this. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- First off, I bought this off of hihonor.com - the manufacturer's website for their phones - because the phone was back ordered on Amazon for like a month. Having said that... this phone is simply no good. I wouldn't say I had high expectations for the phone necessarily (it's $200 after all), but I definitely didn't expect my streaming app to constantly stop or hiccup, whether on WiFi or 4G. I also didn't expect to have to wait 30 seconds or more for the camera to be ready to use, nor did I expect it to be inoperable once it was on the screen (pressing the shutter doesn't always work... sometimes it takes a LONG time to respond, sometimes it doesn't respond). Then when it does finally work the quality of pictures is subpar. Sorry, let me correct that, in full blazing daylight the pictures look great. Good color and great detail. I can see the individual strands of fur on my dogs. However, if there's a single cloud in the sky the pictures are awful. Heaven forbid you try to take night or indoor shots. Another big issue is that the alarm app. doesn't work. I have no idea why... it just doesn't. I had to download a third party alarm app. to even use the alarm on the phone. I tested this multiple times and multiple ways (alarm vs. timer, overnight vs. a few minutes, etc.) and the alarm only sounds if, and only if, you manually turn the screen on while it should be going off. So, in other words, if you don't manually turn the screen on at 6AM when the alarm goes off, you'll never know it's going off. Yup! Fun stuff. Want to turn down your phone? TOO BAD! This only lets you turn down the call volume a little bit. The lowest volume is still eardrum blastingly loud. I'm quite certain the 30 minute call I just had damaged my hearing. (Yes, this sounds like I'm being a bit dramatic but I assure you it's still very loud. And to top that off my supervisor speaks loudly, which is why I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN DOWN THE VOLUME... but alas, the brilliant minds at Huawei apparently know what's better for my ears than me.) Sadly I threw away the box just a couple of days ago, so now I can no longer send it back. So, basically, I'm out $200 unless I can sell it and recoup some of my losses. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PHONE. Seriously. Cough up a little bit more and get a better phone. This is a shame because the V10 looks like it might be a solid phone, but due to the issues with this I simply won't ever buy it.",

In the end, I had to return the phone because the apps continued to freeze up giving me a wait or quit app alert. This happened a lot when trying to use the camera. Then the EMUI would crash.

I tried everything to get the phone to run smoothly, the software comes with a lot of tools to clear memory and it still didn't help. It seems that it's just EMUI that's buggy. For instance, Twitter was extremely annoying to use because as I scrolled it would randomly sense my scrolling as selecting and I would open a tweet, same occurred on YouTube where it would randomly select a video as I was scrolling. It happened when browsing the internet, basically anywhere. I tried changing the launcher but it did nothing to help the lag and random selecting.",

The dual SIM cannot be used in USA with ATT or TMobile as it supports only 2G networks. In USA AT&T dropped support for 2G networks in 2016. T-Mobile does not support 2G either. So you cannot get a signal on 2G SIM, which means no calls or data... Also Huawei customer support is a joke. I called several times to their Mexico center for a return as I purchased the phone directly from Huawei Honor store (with 15 days returns). The system did not even accept the option for providing negative feedback. It could have been much better if it had better speaker, dual SIM supported at least 3G and the customer service definitely needs a major uplift. There is no NFC support as well. At the minimum, the speaker needs to be way better. I went ahead with the LG V20 which is awesome and sells for around $220.",

Loved the screen size on the 7x over the A1 but that was about it. First off, the difference in cost was $37 dollars more for the A1. For that you get 4GB of Ram compared to 3 for the 7x - 64gb of storage on the A1 compared to 32 on the 7x. 32 just won't do it for me. Pure Stock Google UI on the A1 as opposed to EMUI on 7x which means timely OS updates. The A1 has already been updated to Oreo 8.0 while who knows when Honor is going to update the 7x. Dual camera on the A1 is better than the camera on the 7x also. For $30 more it was an easy choice for me to return the 7x (which that experience in itself was a nightmare), was an easy choice!",

But be aware, I'll describe my 2 hour experience with it: just got it last week, I live outside US and need to pay shipping and taxes to get it (My cost increase)... Once with me, I must admit the phone looks nice and stylish, the screen resolution and ratio are super, the camera is mediocre but it is a $200 unit, I did the basic setup and began using it, after some seconds of inactivity it will turn OFF the screen as most phones do and here is where my issues began, I was not able to turn the screen ON again, only a forced restart will do the job. I contacted Amazon for this issue and a technician helped me to do several factory resets and the phone did not fix the issue, we did both Soft Reset and attempted a Hard Reset (Phone never show the Recovery after several attempts, this is something unacceptable for an Android phone)... We were not able to fix it and my only option now is to sent it back to get a refund (I will need to pay shipping again). All this problem makes me believe that Honor/Huawei is not a brad to trust, how can a device get into the market without proper quality assurance to validate the screen and Recovery are working fine? My advice: look into another option and save your time and money.",

                "review_text": "I am writing this review from using this phone as my personal one for a week. I was really excited to try this phone out and maybe replace my iPhone se with it. Here\u2019s how it went. The pros of the phone 1. The screen is huge, vibrant and beautiful. I am seriously impressed by it and the looks of the phones metal casing. 2. The finger print reader is amazingly fast and it so much better the iPhones by far. The placement of the scanner it perfect as well. Although, this phone doesn\u2019t support android pay...how? 3. This is a half and half. The cameras are nice but it\u2019s kinda funny how this has an 8 mp camera compared to the iPhone se\u2019s 2mp. Yet, the iPhone camera quality looks way better than any that this can take. Annnnd that\u2019s it for pros lol Cons: 1 Camera: as I stated, all the hype not allot of preformance takes forever to try to get to the app and you can\u2019t access it from the lock screen. You\u2019ll always miss the shot. 2. Battery life: this phone drains extremely fast it\u2019ll be dead before the day is over and that\u2019s only light use. Occasionally texting and a couple calls. 3. GUI: the user interface is an awful experience making you go to extreme lengths to do the simplest tasks. Very little shortcuts for cameras flashlights or screenshots. Basically all the things you need to do fast. 4. Maybe one of the worst things about this phone is the vibrating motor and notifications. This phone always fails to show you that you have a text or a call. No matter what you do it never shows anything in the lock screen. You have to constantly check every single one of your apps to see if you have a new message. Example: Snapchat there is no notification and no badge app icon. You have to check the app frequently to see if you got one. The vibrations motor, when it does go off, is the lightest feather-like vibration ever. You\u2019ll never feel it. So if you want everyone to hate you because you never reply...this phone is a good option. 5. Processor: the processor is really underpowered for what they are trying to make this phone do. Maybe this is what is causing all the other problems like short battery life (proccecor being overworked by its normal use). From day one I had this phone freeze up at least twice a day. It\u2019s very slow trying to run or send anything. 6. Speakers: the single down firing speaker is awful. The volume is very quiet for what you would expect from a phone this size. There is absolutely no bass and from an equalizer standpoint the sound it flat. 7. Micro USB port: seriously? Micro not even USB type C? Not only that it is designed incorrectly so when you plug in a charger to it the cord will just fall out with the force of gravity on the cord. (Very fun to wake up to a phone with 3%). Also, it doesn\u2019t support fast charging. 8. Honor? Okay this phone and it\u2019s software is basically an iPhone 7 ripoff. Literally everything. Even the settings menu is made to look identical. To think they named this phone \u201chonor\u201d with the absolute lack of it. 9. Hacking. Very angry about this and it was the point in which I sent it back immediately. When you take a photo it provides a location of where it\u2019s taken. Well when I started taking photos. Every once in awhile my phone would show that my photo was taken in China. China? I was in the U.S. not China. So my photos are being sent to China and that\u2019s the last of that phone. I\u2019ll upload the screenshot of the proof of this.",

Everything is great about this phone for the price; great cameras, build quality and look. I trusted Asus because I've bought motherboards from them before. Also one of the biggest things for me about this phone is that there is NO BLOATWARE, unlike Samsung phones. There are a few preinstalled apps but nothing that really gets in your face and pisses you off like other brands. The UI looks nice as well. Makes you feel kinda unique because you're using a phone brand that barely anyone else uses, but I am so glad that I found this brand of phones.

The finger print scanner is as fast as the iPhone's, and it can be used for payments like on the Google play store. The camera has many great features like time lapse, slow motion (60fps), super resolution, panorama, and 16 others. What is really great is the manual mode which can allow you to have a \"photographer's experience\" where you can control iso, shutter speed, white balance, exposure value, and the focal length. I also enjoy 4k video recording and laser auto focusing. The screen is very vibrant and gets up to 600 nits of brightness which does well outside. Also if you have issues with phone's color temperature or saturation there is a great tool called Splendid which comes preinstalled where you can customize your screen. My issues are that the glass is fairly fragile. I would definitely recommend buying a case for it and definitely a screen protector. Also if you have used an apple phone, you may know that many apps just don't work as well on Android devices. This isn't an issue with this phone, Samsung has some issues with certain apps also. Overall, I would definitely recommend this device.",

The camera upgrades were worthy. The 3 gb RAM is doing faster than my one-year Zenfone 2 4GB and the Zen UI 3.0 is clean and faster. I never needed a launcher and now it is better than ever.

I wanted to find something with comparable processing power, hard drive space, and ram.... And try to stay around $200. After spending a couple of days looking around, comparing specs, and reading reviews, I came across the ASUS ZenFone 3.... It had more processing power, 32 gb hard drive with an expandable hard drive space (up to 1Tb according to the manufacturers website), and 3gb of ram (the iPhone 6 only had 1gb)... And as a bonus, the camera is also an upgrade from the 6.... Not to bad for $230! Over all I'm liking the phone itself. It's my first Android device, so the usual learning curve woes keep coming up- but I was expecting that. I'm with T-Mobile and live in central Washington... While it wasn't the best with the iphone, it did have Wi-Fi assist for making calls and texting... But the ZenFone 3, as far as I can tell so far, doesn't have that function, which means I'm limited to using 3rd party messaging apps (FB messenger) to be able to have any sort of communications with anyone while at work, and most places in town. After researching some it seems that is something ASUS is hopefully working on to make available in a future update (keeping my fingers crossed). Only other thing (so far) I'm struggling with is the voicemail. Either I can't figure where the visual voicemail option is, or it doesn't exist, so that I can pick which message I want to listen to, vs having to physically listen to each message be played all the way through before being prompted to delete or save the message before I can skip to the next one.... Suuuuuper tedious (especially for someone who already struggles with checking voice mail).",

Call clarity is better than my old iPhone 6s. Texting, using the phone's messaging app, is simple but functional though a tad boring. Battery life is very good and can last the whole day from 100% charge at 7AM with heavy wifi and data use, streaming videos, phone calls (2-3 hours total) and heavy texting and Ill still have around 55%-63% battery by 9PM. Camera is just ok and nothing special though the manual mode is fun to use! The ASUS ZenUi is actually pretty interesting and the so-called \"bloatware\" can easily be disabled or uninstalled. What I am nervous about is the glass on the back of the phone which is cool to look at but in my opinion, an unnecessary embellishment. Overall a solid phone if you're after speed, stability, and signal.",

The user interface on this phone is so much better than the Meizu Note 1. I had no idea what I was missing. The phones even have similar specs, but this one is soooo much better. The fingerprint sensor works wonderfully. It is so accurate that even my twin sister couldn't unlock it with her finger no matter how many times we tried. It does not come bogged down with a lot of useless apps, and the user interface has a program that lets you manage the programs and apps that are running so that your phone doesn't slow down. I got this phone because I bought the Asus zenwatch 3. They work very well together the phone itself is is very good quality. It is actually lighter and slimmer then my old meizu. But somehow feels like it has a better quality. It is running the latest version of Android right now (marshmallow) I am interested to see if they update it when the next version comes out. The camera is nice about the same quality as my old phone. However the photo software is really nice and fun to play with. It also came with free cloud storage for pictures or whatever. The 3gb /32 gb is more then enough. All the apps run smooth, and I have plenty of space. And if you think you need more, you can use the second sim card spot for a micro SD card and increase the storage space. All on all I am very impressed with Asus. This phone and the ZenWatch were my first Asus purchases. I am now a loyal customer. If anything goes wrong I will update this review. So if there is no update then you my assume I am blissfully enjoying my new phone.",

It has really great cameras, pictures are crisp and vibrant, also takes 4k video. Battery life is fair after heavy use, video streaming, social networking and heavy gaming. The phone does not over heat like previous ones I have owned. It is upgradeable to android 7.0. I came from Sony Xperia Z3 plus to this phone, pretty much same specs and quality. As I previously wrote, this is a great phone for the price. One year up date: The phone still works how it should. Updated to Oreo this week. Even bought my wife one 5 months ago she also loves the phone. Would buy it again. It a great budget phone.",

Everything is great about this phone for the price; great cameras, build quality and look. I trusted Asus because I've bought motherboards from them before. Also one of the biggest things for me about this phone is that there is NO BLOATWARE, unlike Samsung phones. There are a few preinstalled apps but nothing that really gets in your face and pisses you off like other brands. The UI looks nice as well. Makes you feel kinda unique because you're using a phone brand that barely anyone else uses, but I am so glad that I found this brand of phones. I will be sticking with Asus for phones from now on because of this phone.",

The finger print scanner is as fast as the iPhone's, and it can be used for payments like on the Google play store. The camera has many great features like time lapse, slow motion (60fps), super resolution, panorama, and 16 others. What is really great is the manual mode which can allow you to have a \"photographer's experience\" where you can control iso, shutter speed, white balance, exposure value, and the focal length. I also enjoy 4k video recording and laser auto focusing. The screen is very vibrant and gets up to 600 nits of brightness which does well outside. Also if you have issues with phone's color temperature or saturation there is a great tool called Splendid which comes preinstalled where you can customize your screen. My issues are that the glass is fairly fragile. I would definitely recommend buying a case for it and definitely a screen protector. Also if you have used an apple phone, you may know that many apps just don't work as well on Android devices. This isn't an issue with this phone, Samsung has some issues with certain apps also. Overall, I would definitely recommend this device.",

It came in a original box with a really good earbuds, USB type C charger, manuals and an ejector tool. I thought I wouldnt come with earbuds as on a US version but it surprised me but it is in-ear and I decided to buy another one. The fingerprint sensor is super fast and precise. The camera upgrades were worthy. The 3 gb RAM is doing faster than my one-year Zenfone 2 4GB and the Zen UI 3.0 is clean and faster. I never needed a launcher and now it is better than ever.

I wanted to find something with comparable processing power, hard drive space, and ram.... And try to stay around $200. After spending a couple of days looking around, comparing specs, and reading reviews, I came across the ASUS ZenFone 3.... It had more processing power, 32 gb hard drive with an expandable hard drive space (up to 1Tb according to the manufacturers website), and 3gb of ram (the iPhone 6 only had 1gb)... And as a bonus, the camera is also an upgrade from the 6.... Not to bad for $230! Over all I'm liking the phone itself. It's my first Android device, so the usual learning curve woes keep coming up- but I was expecting that. I'm with T-Mobile and live in central Washington... While it wasn't the best with the iphone, it did have Wi-Fi assist for making calls and texting... But the ZenFone 3, as far as I can tell so far, doesn't have that function, which means I'm limited to using 3rd party messaging apps (FB messenger) to be able to have any sort of communications with anyone while at work, and most places in town. After researching some it seems that is something ASUS is hopefully working on to make available in a future update (keeping my fingers crossed). Only other thing (so far) I'm struggling with is the voicemail. Either I can't figure where the visual voicemail option is, or it doesn't exist, so that I can pick which message I want to listen to, vs having to physically listen to each message be played all the way through before being prompted to delete or save the message before I can skip to the next one.... Suuuuuper tedious (especially for someone who already struggles with checking voice mail).",

Call clarity is better than my old iPhone 6s. Texting, using the phone's messaging app, is simple but functional though a tad boring. Battery life is very good and can last the whole day from 100% charge at 7AM with heavy wifi and data use, streaming videos, phone calls (2-3 hours total) and heavy texting and Ill still have around 55%-63% battery by 9PM. Camera is just ok and nothing special though the manual mode is fun to use! The ASUS ZenUi is actually pretty interesting and the so-called \"bloatware\" can easily be disabled or uninstalled. What I am nervous about is the glass on the back of the phone which is cool to look at but in my opinion, an unnecessary embellishment. Overall a solid phone if you're after speed, stability, and signal.",

Battery life is a solid 2 days of moderate use. The asus software that it comes with is a little bloaty, but some of it is actually useful. It comes with a foreign (UK) charger and US adapter, so it looks a little weird and clunky, but it works great and charges fast.

The very first thing I noticed when I pulled it out of the box was the quality weight and feel of the metal rim and glass back. It feels like a luxury. But flashy-ness aside, it was everything I wanted it to be android wise and functionality wise. EXCEPT FOR THE FACT that you cannot move your apps to the SD card! Now that was a big nono for me. Everything but Asia can be moved to the sd card which helps, but it's not as good as having that feeling of unlimited storage. 8gb of storage IS reserved for system but that's okay. I've learned to accept that 22gb of apps is actually okay and enough. The camera is definitely up to par with the Galaxy S6 and S7! It's fast shutter and laser auto focus really allows for ease of use with stunning results! ZenUI is really something else on this device, I honestly thought it would come across as some sort of Chinese weird UI that tries to be relevant but I was impressed with the crazy amount of customization and over all ease of use. I was able to get used to this thing in less than a day and fell in love with it! It's processor is very very handy for keeping multiple apps open at once and still be able to get that lightning fast response time. The only time it ever kind of chugged was when I downloaded 244 selfies of mine at once! Haha I'm super happy with my purchase (I got it used and it came in looking BRAND NEW) and I recommend you to look into getting this phone if you're getting one to last a long time '",

THE BAD: less than 1 year after buying the phone, it began to slow down, then the top right corner (clock area) of the screen started to turn yellow. It more frequently required a full reboot of the phone daily to speed it up. DISCLAIMER: I initially wanted the 6.8\" ULTRA, but the price was too high at the time. I thought I was getting the 5.5\" Zenfone 3 when I ordered this and - since no returns are allowed - I kept the smaller one just because it would be a major hassle to try and return the 5.2: for a 5.5\" and then start all over again with a new phone so soon.",

                "review_text": "Lightning-fast phone, great camera, easy activation, user-friendly, sleek... MAN! I have been a fan of ASUS products for several years now and the ZenFone 3 does NOT disappoint. I am a prepaid phone user but often, Cricket and BoostMobile have a range of technically limited, unreasonably expensive phones for sale. Still, I have purchased phones through them in the past so as to avoid the contract B.S. Verizon and others put their customers through--of this, I have no regrets. Still! I did not know much about unlocked phones and was intimidated about making the leap. Will service be spotty? Will the activation process be a pain? Are there extra fees and hidden costs?... So far, the answer to each question is a resounding NO. Service is better than ever before, and the device itself runs sooooo smoothly. The 16mp camera is gorgeous. The activation process was as follows: 1) remove sim card from old phone, and 2) insert sim card into new phone. Voila! Immediately, I was able to receive calls, texts, and 4G--all to the same phone number as my previous device. To those of you who are familiar with unlocked phones and perhaps travel internationally, this comes as no surprise but to those of us with little to no experience with unlocked phones, the activation process is often a huge source of anxiety. Activation does not always go so smoothly. If the sim card from my previous device did not fit into the new phone, I would have had to buy a new sim card and transfer the old data to it (you can do this online or in person with most service providers). Also, MAKE SURE that your cell provider uses the GSM networks and others listed to ensure that your new phone will be eligible for service. Make absolutely sure before purchasing any unlocked phone. I did my research into this product and into the guidelines set out by my cell provider before buying and that greatly contributed to the seamless transition I experience in switching to the ASUS ZenFone 3. That's really all it takes to make the switch! I could have bought into a contract for a $1000 phone, I could have bought a $300 phone with weaker specs than the ASUS ZenFone 3, but this time I took a chance on a trustworthy brand (paid about $150) and came out with a device that easily competes with products from Apple and Samsung. Don't sign another contract--buy the ZenFone!",

I'm a long-time Windows Phone user and just made the switch back to Android as Windows Phone is finally losing its steam and becoming less viable. I originally switched from Android five years ago because of ugly UI and excessive bugs. No more! This OS is beautiful and I haven't encountered a bug yet! It's also swayed at least one of my iPhone friends to switch back to Android. My only two gripes are that the phone defaults to Korean (must press a different button in setup to switch) and displays a lot of unnecessary notifications, but both of these are easy to remedy. If you're curious about how to set this up on your mobile carrier, I'd urge you to read up on it online, but it was very simple for me. I'm on T-Mobile, and I just popped the SIM card out of my old phone and put it into this one. Done. No set up with the carrier over the phone, no online activation--I was able to start using it immediately. The only real catch is to make sure the SIM card in your current phone is supported by this one. I think there are three different kinds of SIM cards. The ZenFone 3 has slots for two of them, so chances are you'll be alright--just check first.",

The one we have has the Snapdragon 625 which clocks in faster than my flagship LG V10, which is one generation of processors behind it. He doesn't feel the \"lagginess\" that his HTC One M9 had on a couple of the video heavy games. (The M9 is an excellent device, BTW. It has good speakers, a crisp display, and is not very expensive.) It doesn't get all the bands for AT&T LTE, but he has had no trouble eating up our data streaming video. It is a bit tricky to get the SIM card to work because you have to configure the APN settings by getting them from the ATT website. My ATT store had unprofessional staff there who told me to send the phone back because they didn't know how to admit that they didn't know the answers I needed.

Like 3 hours with no talking and minimal internet activity. I was about to return the thing, but a system update came up and there was a technical note that there was a specific fix in the update for the battery drain issue. Sure enough, when the update was done, the battery issue was completely handled and enjoyed decent battery life until now. Just the other day, there was another system update. While not as bad as before, now the battery is dying after 5 or 6 hours of moderate use, when before the update i was getting 12 or so. Not only that, now the phone will not recognize my laptop when i connect via usb to transfer pictures. There is no place in setting where i can select to make it a media storage device or in anyway affect the usb. And Asus is absolutely zeroville when it comes to technical support. I called their 877 number and they kept me on hold for 3 hours before i hung up.",

If you ask me I believe Samsung and apple had something to do with that spying rumor because they want to keep the competition down in America and Chinese phones pose a threat. After all why buy a phone for 1000 dollars when you can get one almost just as good for less than 300. So with that being said, this phone is amazing. Super fast fingerprint scanner, camera quality is amazing, if you handed this phone to someone who didn't know huawei, they would think you paid three times the amount that you actually did. I asked Huawei about a update to Android 8.0 and they said it is confirmed and should be released in April or May at the latest. The software is well optimized and I can get about 6 hours of screen on time with casual use such as calling, texting, and social media. You can zoom in the screen on apps to take advantage of the 5.9 inch screen. The speakers are not the loudest but the quality is good and clear. The audio through the headphones is really good and it also has a mode to improve it even further giving it a bit more bass. The only downside to me is it isn't USB type c, but with how great this phone is all the pros definitely make up for it having micro USB. With phones like this, from Huawei and xaomi, the days of paying 600 to 1200 for a good for are over.",

                "review_text": "I've been using the Mate SE for the past few days and thought I'd leave a review to help others decide when considering this phone. I've been a Google Nexus (5, 5X, 6P) user for the past several years, so leaving Google devices was a leap of faith for me, but my 6P was experiencing the cold battery shutoff at 40+% issue so it was time to try something new. I want to add a disclaimer that I am including the price point as a major part of my decision to give the phone 4 (really 4.5) stars. I mean, THIS PHONE IS $229!!! A second disclaimer is that I am by no means a power user. My typical uses for my phone are texting, web browsing, watching youtube videos, navigation, some social media, and taking photos. I do not game on my phones, so my review is not evaluating gaming performance. The Pros: -Smooth operation. For my everyday use, the speed of opening apps and switching between apps is great and I have no major complaints. There are occasional times when scrolling isn't quite as smooth as on my 6P or my girlfriends S8+, but this is also being nit picky. Again, 95% of the time its great. -Great screen. The screen is big, the bezels are small, the picture is clear and sharp and the colors are accurate to my eyes. The auto brightness feature also works quickly and seems to adjust to a comfortable level based on the surrounding lighting. -Premium feel. I've been using the phone without a case since I got it and I like how the aluminum body feels in my hand, although it is a little slippery. The buttons feel nice and solid -Fast fingerprint scanner. The finger print scanner is at least as fast as the 6P if not faster, and is quite accurate. I've only had it miss my finger print a handful of times and it was likely my fault for bad placement -Slim design. Because of the small bezels and the thinness of the phone, the mate SE is easier to carry in my pocket than the 6P. -Headphone jack! It has a damn headphone jack for those of us that haven't cut the cord on our headphones yet. -Availability of themes. Having used stock android for the last few years, I didn't particularly like the stock EMUI theme that ships with the phone, but there are theme packs available for download on the play store that allow you to change the theme to pixel, oreo, etc. -Battery performance. Again I'm not a power user, but I have been consistently making it through the day with 60% battery remaining when I plug my phone in before going to sleep. -VALUE!!! During my research for a new phone, this phone offered the best features for the price. Hands down. -Camera IN GOOD LIGHT. In daylight or bright light the camera is actually pretty good if you have a steady hand. The pro mode on the camera allows for pretty decent picture taking if you are willing to adjust some settings. I also like the bokeh/low aperature mode for taking macro shots. Its not as good as the pixel camera, s8/s9 or iphone but its pretty decent IN GOOD LIGHTING. The Mehs: -Bloatware. There isn't a ton of bloatware, but it is a bit annoying that you can't uninstall most of the apps that ship with the phone. I prefer to use the google apps, and I can't delete the stock email app, calendar app, etc. Not a huge deal, but meh. -Nougat. the Mate SE ships with nougat, although a google search will show that Huawei is beta testing Oreo for the 7X and an updated EMUI. Hopefully the stable version is released this spring or summer. -Typing mistakes. I seem to make more mistakes typing on this phone than my 6P for some reason. Perhaps it is the screen protector I have on it which isn't the best. just something to note, not a huge deal. The Bads: -Camera in low light. I'm just going to be honest here, the camera is terrible in low light compared to my 6P. Google is king of image processing and the Mate SE is no where close to any google device in low light camera performance. Keep in mind though, that this phone is also 1/3rd the price of the Pixel 2 and almost a 1/4 the price of the Pixel 2 XL, so a worse camera in some situations is expected at this price point. Overall, if you are in the market for a new phone, and don't want to spend close to $1000 for a new flagship, the Mate SE is definitely a phone to consider if you don't mind the poor low light camera performance. Everything else with the phone feels on par with other big name phones, for a fraction of the price!",

                "review_text": "bought the GOLD version of this Huawei Mate SE for $229 + sales tax from here on amazon. as an iPhone person who recently turned to Huawei, this is a fabulous great phone from Huawei. my iPhone was flaking out because of apple's horrible battery shutdown/slowdown problems. apple jumped the shark trying to fool people about what was really happening with iPhone batteries. anyways, previously got a nice AT&T-branded Huawei Ascend XT2 which was like my training-wheels version to get me ready for this much more powerful unlocked Huawei Mate SE. Huawei got me hooked with its EMUI 5.1 (based on Android 7.0) that is designed to kinda be reminiscent of the iPhone iOS, particularly when you turn off the app drawer, but still a powerful android. so switching to the new Huawei Mate SE was easy peasy. and having 4GB RAM and 64GB storage really helped a lot to make the phone much more comfortable to use without worrying about lack of memory or lack of space. oh, in comparison, looking at the Huawei Honor 7x here on amazon, but for a little bit more in price, the Huawei Mate SE is the definite better buy. both the Huawei Honor 7x and the Huawei Mate SE look the same but the major difference is the Huawei Mate SE is more powerful with the 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. and the Huawei Mate SE is available in a GOLD version. my preferred phone gold color version. yea! definite no brainer. got the Huawei Mate SE. myself originally coming from iPhone, my suggestion to others regarding apps to make the transition in finding very good equivalent apps to iPhone's iMessages, Find My iPhone, and Find My Friends, is to go to the Google Play Store to download WhatsApp, Find My Device (from google), and Family Locator GPS Tracker (from Life360). and if you are like me thinking the android app drawer is a bit bothersome, well, you can turn it off in the settings on this Huawei phone. hopefully this advice should get you started if you want to have a more iphone-like experience on a Huawei phone. my journey is complete moving from iPhone to android where this Huawei Mate SE has become my primary phone. using this phone on AT&T and have 4G LTE. the Wi-Fi is only regular 2.5GHz wifi -- without the 5GHz wifi option (the Huawei Ascend XT2 has both 2.5GHz wifi and 5GHz wifi) but that's just fine if all your WiFi access is mostly to regular 2.5GHz wifi wherever you go and wherever you happen to be. personally still carry an iPhone as a backup phone in my go bag, but this Huawei Mate SE is my main phone now. went through other android phones, then recently got the aforementioned Huawei Ascend XT2, and now have this absolutely beautiful gorgeous Huawei Mate SE. physically very iphone-like and almost similar to the iPhone 7+ with the metal body plus with the dual camera on the back in the top corner like on the iPhone 8+ and then with the more modern 18:9 size front screen like on the iPhone X but without the iPhoneX ugly notch. also this Huawei Mate SE has a real must-have earphone jack. and this absolutely beautiful powerful phone performs smoothly with no lag. and Huawei seems to be hinting that Android 8 and most likely a newer EMUI are on the way for this and other Huawei phones for sometime during March 2018 or whenever. [edit: Honor 7x beta testing Android 8 and EMUI 8 began March 15. with maybe possible full release in April? (because news also reports Honor India says April for official release.) Huawei Mate SE should presumedly also get the android8 upgrade in the same timeframe sometime soonish whenever thereabouts is my guess....] so this phone will get even better with huawei support. yes, this Huawei Mate SE is very satisfactory. very happy with this phone. PS: people have commented in other reviews that if you turn on bluetooth, then the Wi-Fi slows down. this has particularly been reported in amazon reviews for the Honor 7x, and at least one other person mentioned it in a review here for the Huawei Mate SE. so, did a speed test to see what happens with my Huawei Mate SE on my home wifi internet: (1) wifi + no bluetooth had 47Mbps wifi internet speed; but (2) wifi + bluetooth turned on had 31Mbps wifi internet speed. this was tested using the Fast dot com website (which is reportedly owned by Netflix). okay this is with an ARRIS TG2472G cable modem with built-in WiFi that can handle both 2.5GHz and 5GHz, but only 2.5GHz is relevant for the Huawei Mate SE, where my home internet is on the Cox Internet Preferred 100 Plan, and so my plan's internet speed can be as high as 100Mbps on the 5GHz side but typically half that on the 2.5GHz side. of course, we are only concerned with the 2.5GHz wifi. turning on bluetooth and getting 30+ Mbps wifi internet speed doesn't matter in a noticeable way to me on my home internet plan. however, if your home internet is much slower like on a basic starter plan with a maximum speed of 10Mbps or less, then proportionally any decreased wifi speed with bluetooth turned on could possibly be noticeable to you. sorry, if you are a big bluetooth user. me not use an android gear watch or bluetooth earphones. if you really don't use bluetooth, then keep the BT off and this issue won't matter to you when you are on wifi. but if you are out away from home trying to use free wifi which can be congested or which may have throttled speeds already, then this BT issue could affect you -- and so maybe just use cellular data in that situation if you really need your BT. personally, this BT issue is not a deal killer for me. this is a great phone imho. PSS: okay maybe the bluetooth-wifi issue is a load of hooey. tried testing wifi internet speed with the bluetooth turned on while on the Wi-Fi at my parents' home where they have a DLink 2.5GHz wifi router and where my folks are on the Cox basic starter internet plan that has an advertised max speed of 10Mbps: (1) wifi + no bluetooth had wifi internet speeds of 9.8Mbps and 11Mbps; but (2) wifi + bluetooth turned on had wifi internet speeds of 8.4Mbps and 10Mbps. this was tested using the Fast dot com website (which is owned by Netflix). it's like no difference whether bluetooth is turn on or off as to the effect on wifi. but other real life factors could be involved -- that's for any picky bluetooth users to test, such as also using their particular bluetooth devices, because at this point, this so-called bluetooth-wifi issue is a non-issue for me. but my guess is if there is any effect, then it's a combination of your wifi router and/or your bluetooth device(s). (yeah, have previously seen differences in using a bluetooth speaker on my macbook versus on my iphone.) in other words, YMMV. bottomline as far as the Huawei Mate SE goes, get the phone, and if you are like me then you'll most likely love the phone. Another PS: (03/29/2018) just got the latest android security patch dated March 1, 2018 for the android 7 on this Huawei Mate SE. this is update version B130. it's not android 8 yet. comments elsewhere over on the xda-developer forum indicate that testing for android 8 (and also presumedly emui 8) on Huawei Mate SE may occur after testing is finished for the Honor7x. my guess at this point is to expect beta testing in April(?) or May(?) with official final distribution sometime soonish afterwards?? just have to wait and see. okay yeah would love to right now have android 8 (with treble to allow for more timely updates?), but this Huawei Mate SE, with android 7.0 and EMUI 5.1, plus with the latest android security update, is a very good reasonably up-to-date secure phone. my bottomline recommendation still stands to say this Huawei Mate SE is definitely a great phone very much worth getting. Yet Another PS (04/17/2018): GSMARENA indicates that Huawei Honor 7x to get EMUI 8, based on Android 8, to officially roll out with final release in May 2018. so maybe beta testing of Android 8 & EMUI 8 for Huawei Mate SE will occur sometime thereafter? could be looking at June/July for official final release on Huawei Mate SE is my current guess?? we'll see.... meanwhile, me currently still very happy with my Huawei Mate SE. oh, an app tip for those who use their Huawei Mate SE in the car: if you need a car app for playing your music and handling your calls & texts while driving, myself using the DRIVEMODE free app (found in the google play store). imho, it's better than Android Auto. can activate & turn off Drivemode from notifications, and overlay Drivemode on top of the music app, plus easy swipes & taps to control my tunes, and big buttons for answering calls & texts as well as voice control to answer calls and to read/answer texts. (oh, with the overlay, you may want to fully increase screen brightness & turn off the eye comfort.) drivemode works great with my whatsapp also. and particularly, the bigger controls (swipe or tap anywhere on the screen) makes it easy to manage my music tunes while driving, kinda sorta like on my old iphone, but different & better on my Huawei Mate SE which is usually docked on the dashboard of my car when me out driving. hope you all are enjoying your Huawei Mate SE (or soon will be if you are looking to get one).",

                "review_text": "I have experience with both flagships (iPhone, Galaxy, Nexud) and \"VFM\" phones (OPO 3T, LG G4) - but I've got to admit that this phone managed to surprise me by surpassing my expectations, BY FAR! For $229 I expected to get something that will be decent, this is a price of a cheap phone so I guessed that it'll show - but the reality is quite different. If you ignore the Huawei brand name and judge the device by its looks & performance, you'll be left with an easy buy for a $400-500 price tag. So for $229 this is a definite no brainer, especially when purchasing directly from Amazon. PROs: + S-C-R-E-E-N (+design) feels high end. They managed to squeeze 6\" into a 5.5\" frame by reducing the edges, the result is extremely good looking. This is by far the best selling point from a user perspective, and it makes most of its competitors look quite bad when comparing side-by-side. + Price + VFM: You're getting about x2-3 what you pay for, that's a crazy bargain. + Battery: 3340 mA/h is big enough for more than a day of use. + SPECs + Performance: 64GB of memory + expendable SD mem slot (or dual sim support), 4GB of RAM, no lag whatsoever (including gaming). I'm amazed of how much they managed to squeeze in for a \"budget\" phone + Day-light camera: way better than my previous OPO 3T (that cost double in time of purchase), dual lens with a stable performance. This is not flag-ship level but it's definitely not \"budget\"-level either. + Finger-tip sensor is working flawlessly and very easy to use. CONs: - Speaker sounds cheap - No USB Type-C, previous generation USB connectivity - No quick-charging capabilities, I also think that it cannot be charged wirelessly (didn't check it though) - Camera performance in the dark isn't too good - Front-facing camera isn't too good - Not the latest android, EMUI GUI isn't for the \"purists\" (but I must admit - it isn't bad at all neither!) The unknowns: ? how will it perform over time, I'll update this review in a couple of months. Bottom line: I believe that the pros outweigh the cons by a long shot. I'd say that this is a nice bargain for $400, so for $229 - with respect - it crushes the competition. I payed for a cheap budget phone and received a great product that could dominate devices that cost x2 MSRP. Big koodos to Huawei for this product, glad that Amazon is selling it (since I wouldn't have the guts to order it without their backup).",

A quick touch to the back of the phone and it's immediately unlocked. I love that! The camera works great and is very responsive. There is hardly any delay when taking pictures. The Honor 5X I had before this one lasted a long time. I had it well over a year at least and I had dropped it numerous times on hard floors and concrete without it ever breaking the screen.

Got this phone for the kid, an upgrade from a much-beloved but no longer supported Amazon FirePhone (itself maligned for all the wrong reasons, a story for another day). The camera has many features popular with the younger crowd (think: filters, background swap, beautify mode, AR ears etc). Android 7, while older, really doesn't bother me, since the latest security updates are available for this phone. We actually like the EMUI interface. May get another one for myself because it blows my older Note 4 out of the water. If anything negative arises, I will update this review. For now... highly recommended. PS Worried about spyware claims from US intelligence services and random senators? How interesting that most of these came about once Huawei surpassed Apple in terms of units sold worldwide. Politicized protectionist nonsense, if you ask me. I am really glad that Amazon didn't cave to the misinformation campaigns, unlike BestBuy, AT&T et al.

                "review_text": "I bought this phone because it has a legit specs under $250 price tag and it didn't disappoint indeed. The phone is impressive compare to samsung's pricy android phones. I've been a Samsung user for years and i would choose this phone over it. The reason I give this phone 4 stars out of 5 is, it doesn't support NFC, a tool for android pay which the latest Samsung phones have. Aside from that, I don't see any advantage the pricy Samsung Galaxy phones have over this great budget phone. Lastly, with regard about the spying allegations on it's makers, I think it's ridiculous! For sure the pricy competetors out there has a real reason to get nervous about how good this company from China make their phone with a budget price tag. Samsung's phone for example is 4x more expensive. Established company phone makers here in the US doesn't want this product getting noticed I think. Spying concerns? Come on! We all know they've been doing it for years already. It's about $ concerns in my opinion. Peace!",

                "review_text": "Yes, there is something missing or not as good, but, for this price tag and what it offers, it is an excellent phone. Highly recommended. It has everything you really need. No NFC (Near Field Communications): You cannot \"Google Pay\" wirelessly, period; No 5Ghz WiFi (You have to stay at crowded 2.4Ghz. It is fine. You really don't feel you miss anything); No replaceable battery; No wireless/fast charging; No water-proof; No high speed USB 3.0; No stereo speakers; No gyroscope (do you really need it?); No native WiFi Calling (if you are a T-Mobile customer, you can use \"T-Mobile DIGITS\" doing WiFi Calling); Camera is not as good at Low Light condition, and without Image Stabilizer (but it is not bad at all and the built-in Camera app has a lot functions.16+2M dual main at f2.2 and 8M front at f2.0); Use old micro-USB port without Type-C (which I like the \"old\" micro-USB that I can use all my chargers and power banks.); And, it has FM radio (yes, good) using 3.5 mm audio (I like the 3.5 mm) headset (not provided) as its antenna; Great 5.93 inch 18:9 display at 1080p x 2160p, 407 ppi (though it is not OLED, great display); Beautiful metal case with clear-color soft TPU protection case; 4GB RAM with 64GB storage (still not enough storage? you can insert in a micro-SD card up to 256GB); Dual-nano-SIM (2nd SIM only for 2G); Excellent finger print sensor with gesture controls; EMUI interface is actually pretty good. You can select between drawer or standard mode; not many \"other\" apps (if you don't use it, you can delete or disable it.)... and it is built by HUAWEI, a big brand in China and Europe.",

They had improved significantly from the 6p. Buttons have good feel, phone is snappy, software is decent. Camera quality is pretty good, but slightly overexposed in my short time with it. Bought for my mother in law, and there was no sense in getting a $1,000 phone that will mostly be used for calling. For what it is, I could genuinely see using this phone as a daily driver if I were short on cash. Obviously I prefer my Pixel 2 XL, but I can tell you this is one darn decent phone. Battery is above my expectations as well. Screen is bright, and big. Easier on older eyes with the Android software letter increase size. If you're looking for something \"good enough\", this phone is a hit. Politically, I don't care what Uncle Sam says about the espionage potential of Huawei. If you are worried about that, avoid smartphones in general. Could snag up a big roll o tin foil too....",

                "review_text": "Okay first of all let me get this out of the way. Do not worry about the chinese government spying on you lol Huawei is there to make money by selling phones, period. If you ask me I believe Samsung and apple had something to do with that spying rumor because they want to keep the competition down in America and Chinese phones pose a threat. After all why buy a phone for 1000 dollars when you can get one almost just as good for less than 300. So with that being said, this phone is amazing. Super fast fingerprint scanner, camera quality is amazing, if you handed this phone to someone who didn't know huawei, they would think you paid three times the amount that you actually did. I asked Huawei about a update to Android 8.0 and they said it is confirmed and should be released in April or May at the latest. The software is well optimized and I can get about 6 hours of screen on time with casual use such as calling, texting, and social media. You can zoom in the screen on apps to take advantage of the 5.9 inch screen. The speakers are not the loudest but the quality is good and clear. The audio through the headphones is really good and it also has a mode to improve it even further giving it a bit more bass. The only downside to me is it isn't USB type c, but with how great this phone is all the pros definitely make up for it having micro USB. With phones like this, from Huawei and xaomi, the days of paying 600 to 1200 for a good for are over.",

                "review_text": "I've been using the Mate SE for the past few days and thought I'd leave a review to help others decide when considering this phone. I've been a Google Nexus (5, 5X, 6P) user for the past several years, so leaving Google devices was a leap of faith for me, but my 6P was experiencing the cold battery shutoff at 40+% issue so it was time to try something new. I want to add a disclaimer that I am including the price point as a major part of my decision to give the phone 4 (really 4.5) stars. I mean, THIS PHONE IS $229!!! A second disclaimer is that I am by no means a power user. My typical uses for my phone are texting, web browsing, watching youtube videos, navigation, some social media, and taking photos. I do not game on my phones, so my review is not evaluating gaming performance. The Pros: -Smooth operation. For my everyday use, the speed of opening apps and switching between apps is great and I have no major complaints. There are occasional times when scrolling isn't quite as smooth as on my 6P or my girlfriends S8+, but this is also being nit picky. Again, 95% of the time its great. -Great screen. The screen is big, the bezels are small, the picture is clear and sharp and the colors are accurate to my eyes. The auto brightness feature also works quickly and seems to adjust to a comfortable level based on the surrounding lighting. -Premium feel. I've been using the phone without a case since I got it and I like how the aluminum body feels in my hand, although it is a little slippery. The buttons feel nice and solid -Fast fingerprint scanner. The finger print scanner is at least as fast as the 6P if not faster, and is quite accurate. I've only had it miss my finger print a handful of times and it was likely my fault for bad placement -Slim design. Because of the small bezels and the thinness of the phone, the mate SE is easier to carry in my pocket than the 6P. -Headphone jack! It has a damn headphone jack for those of us that haven't cut the cord on our headphones yet. -Availability of themes. Having used stock android for the last few years, I didn't particularly like the stock EMUI theme that ships with the phone, but there are theme packs available for download on the play store that allow you to change the theme to pixel, oreo, etc. -Battery performance. Again I'm not a power user, but I have been consistently making it through the day with 60% battery remaining when I plug my phone in before going to sleep. -VALUE!!! During my research for a new phone, this phone offered the best features for the price. Hands down. -Camera IN GOOD LIGHT. In daylight or bright light the camera is actually pretty good if you have a steady hand. The pro mode on the camera allows for pretty decent picture taking if you are willing to adjust some settings. I also like the bokeh/low aperature mode for taking macro shots. Its not as good as the pixel camera, s8/s9 or iphone but its pretty decent IN GOOD LIGHTING. The Mehs: -Bloatware. There isn't a ton of bloatware, but it is a bit annoying that you can't uninstall most of the apps that ship with the phone. I prefer to use the google apps, and I can't delete the stock email app, calendar app, etc. Not a huge deal, but meh. -Nougat. the Mate SE ships with nougat, although a google search will show that Huawei is beta testing Oreo for the 7X and an updated EMUI. Hopefully the stable version is released this spring or summer. -Typing mistakes. I seem to make more mistakes typing on this phone than my 6P for some reason. Perhaps it is the screen protector I have on it which isn't the best. just something to note, not a huge deal. The Bads: -Camera in low light. I'm just going to be honest here, the camera is terrible in low light compared to my 6P. Google is king of image processing and the Mate SE is no where close to any google device in low light camera performance. Keep in mind though, that this phone is also 1/3rd the price of the Pixel 2 and almost a 1/4 the price of the Pixel 2 XL, so a worse camera in some situations is expected at this price point. Overall, if you are in the market for a new phone, and don't want to spend close to $1000 for a new flagship, the Mate SE is definitely a phone to consider if you don't mind the poor low light camera performance. Everything else with the phone feels on par with other big name phones, for a fraction of the price!",

                "review_text": "bought the GOLD version of this Huawei Mate SE for $229 + sales tax from here on amazon. as an iPhone person who recently turned to Huawei, this is a fabulous great phone from Huawei. my iPhone was flaking out because of apple's horrible battery shutdown/slowdown problems. apple jumped the shark trying to fool people about what was really happening with iPhone batteries. anyways, previously got a nice AT&T-branded Huawei Ascend XT2 which was like my training-wheels version to get me ready for this much more powerful unlocked Huawei Mate SE. Huawei got me hooked with its EMUI 5.1 (based on Android 7.0) that is designed to kinda be reminiscent of the iPhone iOS, particularly when you turn off the app drawer, but still a powerful android. so switching to the new Huawei Mate SE was easy peasy. and having 4GB RAM and 64GB storage really helped a lot to make the phone much more comfortable to use without worrying about lack of memory or lack of space. oh, in comparison, looking at the Huawei Honor 7x here on amazon, but for a little bit more in price, the Huawei Mate SE is the definite better buy. both the Huawei Honor 7x and the Huawei Mate SE look the same but the major difference is the Huawei Mate SE is more powerful with the 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. and the Huawei Mate SE is available in a GOLD version. my preferred phone gold color version. yea! definite no brainer. got the Huawei Mate SE. myself originally coming from iPhone, my suggestion to others regarding apps to make the transition in finding very good equivalent apps to iPhone's iMessages, Find My iPhone, and Find My Friends, is to go to the Google Play Store to download WhatsApp, Find My Device (from google), and Family Locator GPS Tracker (from Life360). and if you are like me thinking the android app drawer is a bit bothersome, well, you can turn it off in the settings on this Huawei phone. hopefully this advice should get you started if you want to have a more iphone-like experience on a Huawei phone. my journey is complete moving from iPhone to android where this Huawei Mate SE has become my primary phone. using this phone on AT&T and have 4G LTE. the Wi-Fi is only regular 2.5GHz wifi -- without the 5GHz wifi option (the Huawei Ascend XT2 has both 2.5GHz wifi and 5GHz wifi) but that's just fine if all your WiFi access is mostly to regular 2.5GHz wifi wherever you go and wherever you happen to be. personally still carry an iPhone as a backup phone in my go bag, but this Huawei Mate SE is my main phone now. went through other android phones, then recently got the aforementioned Huawei Ascend XT2, and now have this absolutely beautiful gorgeous Huawei Mate SE. physically very iphone-like and almost similar to the iPhone 7+ with the metal body plus with the dual camera on the back in the top corner like on the iPhone 8+ and then with the more modern 18:9 size front screen like on the iPhone X but without the iPhoneX ugly notch. also this Huawei Mate SE has a real must-have earphone jack. and this absolutely beautiful powerful phone performs smoothly with no lag. and Huawei seems to be hinting that Android 8 and most likely a newer EMUI are on the way for this and other Huawei phones for sometime during March 2018 or whenever. [edit: Honor 7x beta testing Android 8 and EMUI 8 began March 15. with maybe possible full release in April? (because news also reports Honor India says April for official release.) Huawei Mate SE should presumedly also get the android8 upgrade in the same timeframe sometime soonish whenever thereabouts is my guess....] so this phone will get even better with huawei support. yes, this Huawei Mate SE is very satisfactory. very happy with this phone. PS: people have commented in other reviews that if you turn on bluetooth, then the Wi-Fi slows down. this has particularly been reported in amazon reviews for the Honor 7x, and at least one other person mentioned it in a review here for the Huawei Mate SE. so, did a speed test to see what happens with my Huawei Mate SE on my home wifi internet: (1) wifi + no bluetooth had 47Mbps wifi internet speed; but (2) wifi + bluetooth turned on had 31Mbps wifi internet speed. this was tested using the Fast dot com website (which is reportedly owned by Netflix). okay this is with an ARRIS TG2472G cable modem with built-in WiFi that can handle both 2.5GHz and 5GHz, but only 2.5GHz is relevant for the Huawei Mate SE, where my home internet is on the Cox Internet Preferred 100 Plan, and so my plan's internet speed can be as high as 100Mbps on the 5GHz side but typically half that on the 2.5GHz side. of course, we are only concerned with the 2.5GHz wifi. turning on bluetooth and getting 30+ Mbps wifi internet speed doesn't matter in a noticeable way to me on my home internet plan. however, if your home internet is much slower like on a basic starter plan with a maximum speed of 10Mbps or less, then proportionally any decreased wifi speed with bluetooth turned on could possibly be noticeable to you. sorry, if you are a big bluetooth user. me not use an android gear watch or bluetooth earphones. if you really don't use bluetooth, then keep the BT off and this issue won't matter to you when you are on wifi. but if you are out away from home trying to use free wifi which can be congested or which may have throttled speeds already, then this BT issue could affect you -- and so maybe just use cellular data in that situation if you really need your BT. personally, this BT issue is not a deal killer for me. this is a great phone imho. PSS: okay maybe the bluetooth-wifi issue is a load of hooey. tried testing wifi internet speed with the bluetooth turned on while on the Wi-Fi at my parents' home where they have a DLink 2.5GHz wifi router and where my folks are on the Cox basic starter internet plan that has an advertised max speed of 10Mbps: (1) wifi + no bluetooth had wifi internet speeds of 9.8Mbps and 11Mbps; but (2) wifi + bluetooth turned on had wifi internet speeds of 8.4Mbps and 10Mbps. this was tested using the Fast dot com website (which is owned by Netflix). it's like no difference whether bluetooth is turn on or off as to the effect on wifi. but other real life factors could be involved -- that's for any picky bluetooth users to test, such as also using their particular bluetooth devices, because at this point, this so-called bluetooth-wifi issue is a non-issue for me. but my guess is if there is any effect, then it's a combination of your wifi router and/or your bluetooth device(s). (yeah, have previously seen differences in using a bluetooth speaker on my macbook versus on my iphone.) in other words, YMMV. bottomline as far as the Huawei Mate SE goes, get the phone, and if you are like me then you'll most likely love the phone. Another PS: (03/29/2018) just got the latest android security patch dated March 1, 2018 for the android 7 on this Huawei Mate SE. this is update version B130. it's not android 8 yet. comments elsewhere over on the xda-developer forum indicate that testing for android 8 (and also presumedly emui 8) on Huawei Mate SE may occur after testing is finished for the Honor7x. my guess at this point is to expect beta testing in April(?) or May(?) with official final distribution sometime soonish afterwards?? just have to wait and see. okay yeah would love to right now have android 8 (with treble to allow for more timely updates?), but this Huawei Mate SE, with android 7.0 and EMUI 5.1, plus with the latest android security update, is a very good reasonably up-to-date secure phone. my bottomline recommendation still stands to say this Huawei Mate SE is definitely a great phone very much worth getting. Yet Another PS (04/17/2018): GSMARENA indicates that Huawei Honor 7x to get EMUI 8, based on Android 8, to officially roll out with final release in May 2018. so maybe beta testing of Android 8 & EMUI 8 for Huawei Mate SE will occur sometime thereafter? could be looking at June/July for official final release on Huawei Mate SE is my current guess?? we'll see.... meanwhile, me currently still very happy with my Huawei Mate SE. oh, an app tip for those who use their Huawei Mate SE in the car: if you need a car app for playing your music and handling your calls & texts while driving, myself using the DRIVEMODE free app (found in the google play store). imho, it's better than Android Auto. can activate & turn off Drivemode from notifications, and overlay Drivemode on top of the music app, plus easy swipes & taps to control my tunes, and big buttons for answering calls & texts as well as voice control to answer calls and to read/answer texts. (oh, with the overlay, you may want to fully increase screen brightness & turn off the eye comfort.) drivemode works great with my whatsapp also. and particularly, the bigger controls (swipe or tap anywhere on the screen) makes it easy to manage my music tunes while driving, kinda sorta like on my old iphone, but different & better on my Huawei Mate SE which is usually docked on the dashboard of my car when me out driving. hope you all are enjoying your Huawei Mate SE (or soon will be if you are looking to get one).",

                "review_text": "I have experience with both flagships (iPhone, Galaxy, Nexud) and \"VFM\" phones (OPO 3T, LG G4) - but I've got to admit that this phone managed to surprise me by surpassing my expectations, BY FAR! For $229 I expected to get something that will be decent, this is a price of a cheap phone so I guessed that it'll show - but the reality is quite different. If you ignore the Huawei brand name and judge the device by its looks & performance, you'll be left with an easy buy for a $400-500 price tag. So for $229 this is a definite no brainer, especially when purchasing directly from Amazon. PROs: + S-C-R-E-E-N (+design) feels high end. They managed to squeeze 6\" into a 5.5\" frame by reducing the edges, the result is extremely good looking. This is by far the best selling point from a user perspective, and it makes most of its competitors look quite bad when comparing side-by-side. + Price + VFM: You're getting about x2-3 what you pay for, that's a crazy bargain. + Battery: 3340 mA/h is big enough for more than a day of use. + SPECs + Performance: 64GB of memory + expendable SD mem slot (or dual sim support), 4GB of RAM, no lag whatsoever (including gaming). I'm amazed of how much they managed to squeeze in for a \"budget\" phone + Day-light camera: way better than my previous OPO 3T (that cost double in time of purchase), dual lens with a stable performance. This is not flag-ship level but it's definitely not \"budget\"-level either. + Finger-tip sensor is working flawlessly and very easy to use. CONs: - Speaker sounds cheap - No USB Type-C, previous generation USB connectivity - No quick-charging capabilities, I also think that it cannot be charged wirelessly (didn't check it though) - Camera performance in the dark isn't too good - Front-facing camera isn't too good - Not the latest android, EMUI GUI isn't for the \"purists\" (but I must admit - it isn't bad at all neither!) The unknowns: ? how will it perform over time, I'll update this review in a couple of months. Bottom line: I believe that the pros outweigh the cons by a long shot. I'd say that this is a nice bargain for $400, so for $229 - with respect - it crushes the competition. I payed for a cheap budget phone and received a great product that could dominate devices that cost x2 MSRP. Big koodos to Huawei for this product, glad that Amazon is selling it (since I wouldn't have the guts to order it without their backup).",

A quick touch to the back of the phone and it's immediately unlocked. I love that! The camera works great and is very responsive. There is hardly any delay when taking pictures. The Honor 5X I had before this one lasted a long time. I had it well over a year at least and I had dropped it numerous times on hard floors and concrete without it ever breaking the screen.

Got this phone for the kid, an upgrade from a much-beloved but no longer supported Amazon FirePhone (itself maligned for all the wrong reasons, a story for another day). The camera has many features popular with the younger crowd (think: filters, background swap, beautify mode, AR ears etc). Android 7, while older, really doesn't bother me, since the latest security updates are available for this phone. We actually like the EMUI interface. May get another one for myself because it blows my older Note 4 out of the water. If anything negative arises, I will update this review. For now... highly recommended. PS Worried about spyware claims from US intelligence services and random senators? How interesting that most of these came about once Huawei surpassed Apple in terms of units sold worldwide.

It has everything you really need. No NFC (Near Field Communications): You cannot \"Google Pay\" wirelessly, period; No 5Ghz WiFi (You have to stay at crowded 2.4Ghz. It is fine. You really don't feel you miss anything); No replaceable battery; No wireless/fast charging; No water-proof; No high speed USB 3.0; No stereo speakers; No gyroscope (do you really need it?); No native WiFi Calling (if you are a T-Mobile customer, you can use \"T-Mobile DIGITS\" doing WiFi Calling); Camera is not as good at Low Light condition, and without Image Stabilizer (but it is not bad at all and the built-in Camera app has a lot functions.16+2M dual main at f2.2 and 8M front at f2.0); Use old micro-USB port without Type-C (which I like the \"old\" micro-USB that I can use all my chargers and power banks.); And, it has FM radio (yes, good) using 3.5 mm audio (I like the 3.5 mm) headset (not provided) as its antenna; Great 5.93 inch 18:9 display at 1080p x 2160p, 407 ppi (though it is not OLED, great display); Beautiful metal case with clear-color soft TPU protection case; 4GB RAM with 64GB storage (still not enough storage? you can insert in a micro-SD card up to 256GB); Dual-nano-SIM (2nd SIM only for 2G); Excellent finger print sensor with gesture controls; EMUI interface is actually pretty good. You can select between drawer or standard mode; not many \"other\" apps (if you don't use it, you can delete or disable it.)... and it is built by HUAWEI, a big brand in China and Europe.",

They had improved significantly from the 6p. Buttons have good feel, phone is snappy, software is decent. Camera quality is pretty good, but slightly overexposed in my short time with it. Bought for my mother in law, and there was no sense in getting a $1,000 phone that will mostly be used for calling. For what it is, I could genuinely see using this phone as a daily driver if I were short on cash. Obviously I prefer my Pixel 2 XL, but I can tell you this is one darn decent phone. Battery is above my expectations as well. Screen is bright, and big. Easier on older eyes with the Android software letter increase size. If you're looking for something \"good enough\", this phone is a hit. Politically, I don't care what Uncle Sam says about the espionage potential of Huawei. If you are worried about that, avoid smartphones in general. Could snag up a big roll o tin foil too....",

                "review_text": "Hi everyone, this is my first review EVER on Amazon but I figured it is worth the time. I recently purchased the Huawei Mate SE - first of all, it arrived earlier than expected so that was great. Once I received it, I noticed that the phone is just a tiny bit bigger than what I am usually used to but this is no biggy - you get used to it pretty fast. I ordered it in gold and I am loving it so far - the camera is very nice and takes great, crisp pictures. I honestly bought it because I wanted a phone with a larger memory, good camera and bokeh effect (lol). This is the first time I am purchasing a Huawei phone but the reviews on here and other websites really convinced me and so far, no regrets. I do have friends that own iPhones so I can say portrait mode isn't as perfect or fast as on iPhones but the pictures do turn out pretty nice once you get the hang of it. Let's bear in mind that this is a $220 phone vs a $900-$1,000 phone. Oh and BIG PLUS! The battery life really is AMAZING, it charges super fast, and not just because it is a brand new phone. The Huawei boasts its long-lasting battery charge in its latest phones, and I can definitely confirm :) I hope this helps you make your decision - If I had had more budget, I would have gone with the Huawei Mate 9 or 10 Pro (with Leica cam and so forth) but I am so pleased with my purchase so far.",

                "review_text": "There is no other way to put it, this is an excellent device at excellent value. The only complaint I have is the confusion with how many devices there are from Huawei for different markets. I purchased 2 phones BEFORE this one. First a Nexus 6P (more for Google, but because Huawei built this phone I was more comfortable trying a pure Huawei phone afterwards) then an Honor 7X. This is where I had some trouble, because I purchased the international version, which was not made clear as to what networks it supports in the U.S, and many different websites have conflicting information based on whether you pull up the 3GB RAM model VS the 4GB RAM model. It's difficult to have confidence in your purchase when buying elsewhere, but buying the Mate SE from Amazon definitely gave me security and confidence in the choice I was making. As for the device. WOW... I knew I wanted to get it for the extra gig of ram and the Octa-core processor, but this phone continues to impress. I haven't had a single hick-up or issue with anything so far, if it weren't for the network issue I would have never gotten rid of the 4GB RAM 7X, the Mate SE makes you very happy that Huawei is working with American distributors because this is a very underrated device. Shipped and arrived next-day, effortless sync, Android experience is smooth, and I do like the skins though I haven't changed any themes myself. Camera is ultra-responsive, finger-print is incredibly accurate and unlocks quicker than half-a second, which is hard to comprehend for the price and something I noticed was also equally responsive on the 7X. Just overall incredibly impressed. Oh and there's a free case which ships with the phone as well, which is just an unexpected plus that makes you happy you chose to support this company. In all honesty, I feel like if OnePlus weren't trying to compete on upper-tier financial markets they would be cranking out phones like this no problem, but they're missing a chance to compete with yet another market that is making unparalleled devices for an unbelievable cost. For the first time my phone has as much RAM as my laptop and I didn't pay too much...",

                "review_text": "I wish I had heard of this company before buying all these second hand Samung/Motorola phones through craigslist just to save money, when I can buy a comparable phone brand new for a price that is cheaper. This phone is just an improved version of the Honor 7X. My review is based off replacing a Samsung Note 4 and my work phone is a Galaxy S7. Battery: The battery life is superb on this. Seeing how my Note 4 had all this bloatware and these Samsung extras out of the box. The Note 4 couldn't even last through out the day with constant usage. This phone lasts through out the day, set it down without charging it for the night and it still has power. Battery life is about the same as the S7, though. Design: Doesn't feel like a cheap, cricket phone. Feels like it has some weight, some heft to it. I am also impressed by the fingerprint technology on the back of the handset. It is much better and responsive then what the Galaxy S7 has. I never had to 'retry' my fingerprint as if it didn't register it. Communications: Haven't noticed any difference in terms of call quality or signal. Yet, my carrier is AT&T. The only concern is that the phone doesn't support 5G Wi-Fi. Camera. Unless something was wrong with my Samsung Note 4, this camera is much better than the Note, but similar to what the S7 has, or maybe even less. Display: I can't tell if this is part of the android or part of Huawei, but there are animations in the display which are interesting. From where you can see the display brightness slider move automatically to where texts seem to 'bounce' when you scroll through them. There is little bloatware and I like the drawer design of the apps. Screen is also bigger than my Note 4. Also some people state the charging cable is different, yet my cord that charges my samsung phones can charge this phone. At the end of the day, this phone can do everything a $1,200 phone can do.",

The camera doesn't do well in low light, but the flash is adequate. Daylight pictures are exceptional. One feature I was meh about before purchasing was the finger print scanner and dang if it isn't the handiest thing ever. I've not had it fail and it gets me inside my phone fast. Flawless. I'm older and have some vision issues, so I appreciate the large screen. The phone was not loaded with bloatware and what few little apps I didn't want I was able to get rid of without a problem. I also have had no issue with any of my favorite apps working on this device. I take all kinds of kidding at the brand and the jokes about being spied on by the Chinese are fun. But honestly I find all's fair in the marketplace and in my estimation this phone is a real winner. I've used Samsung Note 4 and Note 5's, an iphone, and plenty of Blackberry's in my time and this phone tops them all. Seriously a great piece of equipment and an exceptional buy.",

The price is great, for $229, cannot get any phone better than this. CONS: WIFI is only 2.4GHz, it will be a trouble with a lot of neighbors. MicroUSB 2.0 but not Type-C?

Most of the more expensive phones use either glass or crematic for the case. They are heavy and they break easily when you drop your phone accidentally. So you are paying more for expensive phones by having greater risks. Am I a fan of Huawei\u2019s phones? Not yet. I own Huawei Honor 8 and its battery went bad in 11 months, So I will update the review of Mate SE a year from now.

This phone blows it away in almost every aspect and the S6 was the premium flagship that outclassed the previous versions by quite a lot. Now budget phones are beating the former best phones on the market not that long ago, truly amazing. This modified Android I actually like better then stock, it's simple and intuitive. Internet, fingerprint reader, everything is just fast! Love that it still has a straight headphone jack! Don't you dare change that please! Camera is more then good enough but I'm not a picture fanatic so it might not work for those looking for real high end photos from a phone. The AMOLED screen of the old Galaxies are still better then this but not enough to not still make this phone overall better hardware/price wise. The only con I see is not directly related to the phone, and that is case availability. I used to love that Otterbox Defender with a built in screen protector available for previous Galaxy versions. Sadly Otterbox has mostly given up on that and making cases for any other manufacturers besides Apple and Samsung. I ordered a soft pouch for extra protection. I do like that this is a plus size phone, I will never go back to smaller. Buy this phone, you will not be disappointed.",

Fortuantely, I already have AT&T and slipped in the Sim from my iPhone 7, no problems with the LTE and it connected to my router with no problems either. I'm just glad that I didn't have to spend $700+ for a another phone. I'll be putting my iPhone on eBay!",

Construction quality also superb, metal finish seemingly premium. Unlikely to find a better deal for a smartphone of this price at this point in time. Hopefully, Huawei continues their line of budget smartphones, unlike many other companies.",

So far it's a great phone, and my only complaint is no USB C and fast charge, something my 70.00 ZTE had. I ordered a magnetic charge cable that should arrive tomorrow and that will hopefully take care of my dislike for micro USB. Lol. But the phone feels quality, the camera is decent, and the screen is beautiful, and has some neat features. I would definitely purchase again.",

This has exceeded my expectations by far: the processing is extremely fast, the fingerprint is flawless, the EMUI is neat, and the camera is awesome as well. My wife has an iPhone 7 ($750) from At&t and this Mate SE beats it spec wise except for a few things. In my comparing, the iPhone 7 has 4k video recording, and 1080p recording with the front facing camera. However, the front facing camera of this Mate SE has 720p recording which is still high quality. The Mate SE does not film in 4k, however, in my opinion, it makes up for this with the variable apperture. The screen for the Mate SE is very large and has a good brightness with auto-brightness adjustment sensitivity. It is very clear and responsive to your touch. Day to day tasks are a breeze, email, internet, YouTube, etc. You will enjoy your new phone, even if your coming from the top brands. P.s. this phone has a document explorer with a great UI. I know this will come in handy for downloading files and reopening them. Overall I rate 5 \ud83c\udf1f. You just can't beat the quality for price.",

The Sim is a nano site, and the tray for the Sim can hold either a second Sim or a micro SD card to expand the storage. This phone is both carrier unlocked, and comes with a US warranty. Few negatives, does not have a knock code capability. Screen icons look pretty crappy in landscape orientation. Battery is sealed in and not replaceable similar to some other phones.",

Seriously this was a huge reason for me as I noticed they were dwarfing samsung in sales and getting closer to toppling I phone from #1. If you looked at the Honor 7x and wanted a extra Gb of ram and 32 more GB of storage this is a must have. It also boasts a large 5.93\" screen with minimal bezel. Oh so sexy for a budget device. It has a solid build and beautiful screen. After having it for over a week I noticed most complaints were unwarranted since some people are spoiled by more robust screens. Granted this is not a \"flagship level\" phone but for the price it delivers above what any reasonable person would expect. The finger print sensor needed some getting used to. I have never had a phone like this before. It defiantly beet the Galaxy s4, Blu energy x plus, ZTE and other phones I have owned in function and form. I love the screen most although it is not for small handed people except for the shrink feature allowing one handed use. It even has eye comfort built right in. Love that. The US government has no real proof to there allegations since there has not even been a formal charge filed against Huewai and seriously I doubt this company would jeopardize their profit margin with such foolery. If you need a honest opinion buy it you will love it, just remember no matter how good the phone apps can still be less than perfect.",

The mate SE runs very smooth with little to no lag. The phone just performs like a flagship phone. i really don't care that it doesn't have usb type c because all my previous phones were micro usb. except the Blu pure xr which i owned briefly. The only issue i have with the phone is the display which comes out of the box looking a little bit too warm. Luckily , this can be adjusted in the display setting menu. The colors on the display are a little bit muted and i would have loved it if it was more saturated , which would have let the colors pop out more. I wish they would have put a color saturation slider in the settings menu, honestly i don't know why phone makers don't have this option by default (The closest i have seen to it is video enhance on the note 8). This phone seems to have the same color issue with the Pixel XL 2, although google fixed that with an update. I hope Huawei will also update the color saturation and make it more vivid. This is still a fantastic phone, which i have no regrets buying. I have no problem recommending this phone. Update: I recently noticed that the brightness of the screen would automatically dim when I open apps even though I have got auto brightness set to off. Huawei needs to look into this issue.",

                "review_text": "After losing my 4th iPhone to water damage (my own fault), I just couldn't justify purchasing another $700-$1000 phone. Apple makes great products,but their premium tech comes at a premium price. This forced me to look towards android. I saw this phone on amazon with exceptional ratings and I decided to take the leap. After a week of use, All I can say is Wow! What an amazing phone, especially considering the price tag. It feels like a device that's two to three times more expensive and comes loaded with a crazy amount of tech. As a longtime apple fan, I've gotta say that this is pretty amazing. The screen is beautiful, the processor is faster than my iPhone 6, the 64 gigs is more than substantial (I installed a 64g micro SD (another benefit over apple) so memory is effectively 128g), and the fingerprint sensor is faster and more effective than any sensor I've used before. It's thin, lightweight, feels good in the hand and the nav buttons are intuitive and easy to use. Perhaps my favorite feature is the battery. Even as I write this review I've been using the device pretty heavily today (at least 7 hours of moderate to heavy use) and I'm still sitting at 82% battery. That's phenomenal. The front camera is great, mostly when using the pro mode, although it's easy to wash out pics especially in high sun without adjusting the settings. The selfie camera does leave a bit to be desired (image quality seems lower than the 8mp they advertise, sometimes appearing grainy) but that's not a huge deal for me. My final caveat is the speaker. It's fine for browsing videoes and that sort of thing but don't expect it to get loud. I almost struggled to hear calls while on speaker phone with minimal-moderate background noise. It's not a huge deal since I just switched it over to the ear piece and the call quality was clear and loud. Bottom line, this is the best phone I've ever owned considering the amount of tech vs the price tag. It easily feels like a $500-$600 device. I'm a fan. PS the Chinese government has yet to contact me and my credit card accounts remain secure. I think we can stand on the huawei tech threat.",

I wanted a phone with good specs that would be a significant upgrade, however I was not willing to pay the price of a laptop for a cellphone. I believe these Huawei phones represent an excellent value due to the current state of trade relations between the US and China. Because of political uncertainty, Huawei has had to alter their original plans of distributing their phones via popular US retailers like Best Buy. They are basically selling direct to consumer now. I'm guessing that Huawei probably has too much inventory on hand since the Best Buy deal fell through. Without marketing or any significant US brand-recognition, these phones are selling CHEAP. You might think there's something wrong with them... there's not. This is a great device! I'm considering buying a second one just to have as a backup. Huawei and Foxconn (Taiwan based manufacturer that handles a lot of the manufacturing for Apple) work closely together. I believe they even share some of the same factory space. The phone takes two SIM cards at once, it's globally unlocked, and it doesn't come with too much Huawei customization to the stock Android experience. I disabled all the Huawei apps from receiving updates and changed the default preferences back to the Google apps. The only thing I wish this phone had is wireless charging, and that I can live without for a $200 iPhone clone. Oh, it uses regular USB instead of a lightning connector, and even has a standard headphone jack... image that! Take my advice and give it a try, if you don't like it return it.",

So far I haven't experienced any major lags or slowdowns. There will be some minor lags, but not so much that you'll really notice or get bothered by it. There are three things that you should consider when buying this phone which is the speaker, the ear speaker and there aren't that many good screen protectors and cases. The speaker is not that loud, but for $250 I can't complain. When making a call you might want to be in a quiet place. I found myself having trouble hearing the person, but the audio is clear. I've bought a few screen protectors and most of them don't fit or causes the rainbow edge effect. My advice is to not purchase any temper glass screen protectors for this phone.There are many cases but the quality isn't that great. Right now, I'm using this case https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0794ZYN4D/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and although it doesn't have the best grip I like it a lot. It is a bit bulky but I like my phone to be a bit bulky so consider this when purchasing this case. Besides these three issues, this phone is fantastic and a major go. The screen is huge, the camera is decent but I don't use it that often, the phone is fast with no feelings of slowness, and the fingerprint sensor is usually accurate and really fast. So far $250 I think this is an absolute buy and a great deal. It is also said that it will be updated to Android 8.0 but don't quote me on this.",

Excellent build quality, blazing fast 2.4 GHz processor, ample storage space, smooth sound, user friendly and beautiful EMUI 5.0..... most impressive of all, the camera! See the snow scenes I took. I say the camera itself worthy the $229 I paid for! I LOVE IT! I can not believe a flagship phone costs this low! The casing feels lighter than the Mate 10 Pro, which costs much more. That is perfect for me. I strongly recommend the phone, to those can not bear infinite OS upgrades, just to welcome more bugs, and cheap tricks that slow down their devices. Good job, Huawei!",

                "review_text": "If I could get this with 8GB/128GB I would order it at this instant. I had to upgrade my Samsung J7 Sky Pro even though I loved it dearly. I needed more memory, etc. To be honest, I didn't do a whole lot of research but I loved the specs on this phone. The reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere such as YouTube were very positive. I'd never heard of Huawei before. I took a chance and ordered it. If it didn't work out, I'd return it. Well, it's not going back. I absolutely love it. Not more than 5 minutes after I turned it on, I felt as if I had been living in the Dark Ages. Whole new worlds spread out before me!!! I didn't have the Tracfone SIM yet, but just going through my Wi-Fi was incredible. When I did get the T-Mobile SIM from Tracfone, it took only a few moments to install and move my Samsung account to the Huawei without any need for human interaction. Minutes, data and text all transferred over flawlessly. Popped in the SIM, set it up and within a few minutes voila! 4G! I have no negatives yet except for one thing. The battery. It works fine and does a good job. Powers the phone for a long time and doesn't take a long time to charge, either. Problem is that's it built in. All things considered, it's in NO way a deal breaker. For the $$$, I can't see getting anything better. Indeed, a friend of mine recently acquired the newest iPhone. I gave her my Huawei to play with and she gave me that condescending look (Apple owners practice it alone in front of a mirror at 3AM when no one's watching) whenever they have to touch anything that's not been blessed by the ghost of Steve Jobs. She played with it for about a half hour. When she gave it back, she asked me \"How much did it cost?\" When I told her, she was more than a bit surprised and looked at her mega$$$ phone. \"Not bad,\" she said. Sounds like a compliment to me. UPDATE : It's been over a week now and I love this phone even better. I called Huawei support's 800 number and within a minute, I had an ENGLISH speaking rep on the phone. Within five minutes my question was answered and my problem resolved. This was during peak hours. Is that good or what?",

                "review_text": "I was limping along with my Nexus 6P and it finally decided enough was enough. I wanted an interim phone to get me through to the next Pixel release and decided on this since my Huawei 6P lasted me 2.5 years which is a lot for an android device. I am very impressed with this phone. For the price it is quite feature rich. The system is crazy smooth. The storage is 64GB which is twice that of my 6P. Memory stands strong at 4GB. This is great as long as management of it stays on point. The camera is good. Not great but it is quite usable for a device at this price point. Pros: - 64GB storage - 4GB Ram - 6\" screen - Works on Tmobile and AT&T LTE bands (no verizon or sprint) - Crazy fast fingerprint reader in the CORRECT SPOT - FM Radio and a headphone jack (common in Chinese phones) - Good camera, but won't blow anyone away - Dual SIM with great management tools - Actual good battery life will get you through the day easy - Slick all metal design, this is nice but also slippery. Luckily the phone comes with a free clear case. I bought the Spigen Honor 7X case though. - $230??? Cons: - Micro USB connection, better dig up your old cables - No NFC, I use contactless payment a lot and this hurts - No wireless charging, but this is a metal phone so eh - EMUI skin is quite intrusive, I recommend Nova or Google Launcher on top, much better this way - Only running Android 7.0, hopefully the Honor 7X beta program means Oreo will be coming to this device eventually, don't hold your breath though. - This is a Chinese phone and these companies sometimes have questionable practices when using your personal data. Keep this in mind when buying lower end devices such as this. Probably doesn't matter though since your data is being harvested and sold by all phone manufacturers most likely. Might as well save a buck. Overall I am very happy and impressed with this phone. Budget phones have come so far from the last time I had a lower end phone that I honestly did not expect this device to perform the way it is. This phone is easily worth the price. Micro USB being the biggest downfall of this device is understandable at this price point. This phone may get me to skip the new Pixel altogether! Buy this if you need something to hold you off until the next big thing OR if you are budget minded but still looking for a feature rich device.",

From the outside, the only difference I can see is the color and the camera housing being a single piece on the Mate SE. You can definitely tell the Mate is a little more responsive with the extra RAM. If you weren't already aware, there are some big limitations to these phones. You can only connect to 2.4Ghz wireless and Bluetooth shares an antenna with wifi, which means you get slower performance on wifi when using blootooth. You also don't get fast charging or USB type C, which really isn't a huge deal to me. It seems to charge fast enough. The body is a great size and it really does look very pretty overall. For kids who want something that looks good, but you won't be too concerned about losing or breaking, this is a great option and one I would recommend. At the current price of $230, the extra 30 dollars is worth it over the 7x for the extra memory/storage.",

I know this is the new thing, but new isn't always better. So if your just a fad junkie ( hopefully this is just a fad) this will be your cup of tea. Why phone companies are always changing things that aren't broke, like removable batteries, headphone jacks, need to have a Sim ejector tool just to remove your SD card. I blame these changes on Samsung and Apple, all the other phone companies are just followers. Back to the phone - if you like the 18/9 and don't want to pay a fortune for a phone with a nice screen, great fingerprint reader, and decent camera and battery life this is the phone for you.",

This phone has almost everything I want and provides me with all the functionality I need. It is essentially an Honor7X with upgraded RAM and storage making it equal to the Honor7X released in the rest of the world outside of the US. It has a decent camera, Android 7, 64GB storage, and duo SIM and unlocked for travel. The fingerprint sensor is nicely placed on the back and I don't have to struggle to find it. The battery lasts me for 2 to 3 days depending on my usage (I am not a heavy user). I use it a lot for Spotify in the car and for my home audio system and it works well. It is lightning fast at boot up and loading apps. I find it to be great value. My cost was $229 US. I had considered the new Samsung A8 (2018) but it only had 32GB memory and I felt that it was overpriced at $429 US with the only advantage that I could see for the Samsung product was being IP68 water resistant and protected against dust ingress. Could have done without the bloatware. Some people will dislike the lack of a headphone jack but I only use Bluetooth so it is not an issue for me. Support for NFC would have been a plus. Essentially a great phone and a Huawei Mate SE Factory Unlocked 5.93\" - 4GB/64GB Octa-core Processor| 16MP + 2MP Dual Camera| Grey (US Warranty) great bargain.",

I have put it on battery saver mode, made sure no apps are running in the background and made whatever other setting adjustments I could, but the battery life is still poor. I recharge once during the day for a while, and it is OK. However, I don't think I should have to do that. I am not sure if the battery is a general situation, or if I have just received a bad one. Update 4/2/18: company emailed me about ways to increase battery life. It worked. The battery is now great, and so is this phone, probably the best I have ever owned! Dual sim is awesome.

The price/performance ratio of this device is phenomenal, and it's a joy to use. The sound with Bluetooth and headphones is excellent (there is a headphone jack). There are few bloatware apps, and most can be removed. The version of Android is not stock, but isn't annoying either. Huawei says the device will get Oreo in the future. I am using this phone with T-Mobile in the USA and the call quality is good. The phone can either take 2 SIMs, or 1 SIM and 1 microsd card. I installed my 128 GB microsd, so I have all of my music (ripped CDs) on the device. I like that you can set up the phone to turn on with two taps to the screen. There is a step counter that displays on the lock screen which is useful to me. Battery life seems to be pretty good. After fully charging the phone last night, and spending a lot of time installing software and configuring the phone, the next morning it's still at 60%. I even used the hotspot feature when my ISP had a brief outage, and I'm sure that uses a significant amount of power. After charging to 100%, in the morning it was still at 97%. The camera seems to be good, but I have not taken many photos yet.",

I owned a Moto X Pure which was a Motorola flagship phone and the Huawei Mate SE is lightening fast in comparison. I was a little nervous about the form factor being 8:9 but the phone size fits comfortably my hand. Also, After owning the Moto X Pure and having great sound quality with the two front facing speakers, I was afraid the Huawei Mate SE would pale in comparison. Well, I was surprised that the one speaker has pretty good sound. The only con is that the phone has very few choices for cases and screen protectors. Even it's sister phone (Honor 7X) doesn't have a quality two piece case available. I did end up getting a Skinomi screen protector and a Spigen case. They are adequate for now. UPDATE: Huawei support says Oreo (Android 8) available first of May, 2018 for Huawei Mate SE. If you are hesitant to buy this phone, DON'T BE! I think you will be very pleased with your purchase.",

All apps are quick and snappy, including games and social media. 64 gb storage and the extra money for 1 extra gig of ram and double the storage was worth it to me. 4 gig ram also allows apps to run quick and even when multiple are running its quite fast. 4g lte is also a great bonus, although it's expected in most smartphones these days. Battery life is also very good with its close to 3400 mAh battery. I can be on it all day and still have about 30% by the end of the day, given I would run it for 8 to 10 hours straight. The phone is larger than other phones I have owned and some may feel that the screen ratio is strange. I however don't mind it being a bit taller and slender. Some people are worried that because it's not a flagship phone that it won't perform and that is not the case. Fingerprint scanner is very fast and responsive. The camera is mediocre to say the least but what can you expect from a phone that doesn't break the bank at only $229 dollars. Also, for those who are worried about \"spying\", Huawei is just a company trying to make money like any other. I highly recommend this phone to any who were on the edge about purchasing in the beginning as I was. It is a fantastic product.",

First \"unlocked\" phone I've ever had and the transition couldn't have been any more easier. Just had to run to the T-Mo store to get a new nano sim card because my micro sim card from my old phone didn't fit (didn't even know there were different sim card sizes now). Coming from a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 that was crapping out on my 5th battery after 3+ years, decided to go with this for the screen size at the price mainly. All the knocks on this phone are things and features that it doesn't have (that other phones have as a standard), but if you didn't need it or use it before then chances are you probably won't know it did not exist. It does everything that I wanted my Galaxy Note 4 to do, but faster with double the storage and a nicer screen. I'm already impressed with the battery life but I'm sure that will degrade over time. Still getting used to this version of Android and GUI but it looks neat. My first new mobile device in over three years and I couldn't be anymore happier and impressed especially because of the price. Great bargain if you're looking to upgrade and catch up with the times, haha.",

Good: Screen is very nice and bright Battery life is incredible. will last me two days when my old phone needed charging during each day Camera is amazing. Front camera is as good as my old phone's back camera Comes with a nice clear case Bad: Touch sensor is not great and sometimes registers a tap as a swipe. I wonder if this is a software or hardware problem Form factor -- 2:1 aspect ratio is weird and unusual for android. There's a special button to tell the system to stretch the screen for each app. It has worked in every app I've pressed it, but it seems weird. It's also hard for me to reach the whole screen with one hand. Spyware is factory installed. I usually like to mod my phone and get root and install custom roms. This phone I haven't even rooted yet, but I still leave that open as a possibility. The built in ROM is quite nice it supports themes including dark mode. I've been using DNS66 to block ads. It works ok, but some sites still show ads. This phone doesn't have a section in XDA yet but the previous model (Honor 7x) does and the development is progressing slowly. This phone is bootloader unlock able and root able using the same procedure as the 7x. Today Huawei released Oreo beta for honor 7x in US and I assume that will come to this phone too. Overall I'm quite happy with this device and I think that it's pretty good. I hope that Huawei / Hi Silicon release information about the CPU and camera allowing custom kernel and ROM development.",

When I place a call, for half of the time, I get a message saying 'Call not sent' while the call is already in progress and connected to the network. The lock screen sometime shows and sometimes doesn't show the global clocks, its a hit n miss The Huawei weather widget won't show in the list of widgets, it might only be working with the Huawei skin, but still... I believe the root cause might be a bad integration of NOVA laucher with the Huawei skinned android version or Huawei's reservations with people using launchers in their phones. They do have a warning which warns you about instability of phone with 3rd party launchers. But then I don't think that's how an android phone should be.",

I had reviewed on my opinion after a quick open startup and shut down....without actually really putting any kind of use to base my opinion on because although it says 5.9\" I was a little frustrated as it's actually smaller then my Note 4 and I bought this to replace my aging Samsung Note 4 and after I gave a mediocre review last night my Note gave out this morning just unresponsive. I had printed the return labels and was sending back. Well to my surprise this phone turns out to be the best phone I have ever had, just amazing. The display is so crisp, the audio is pretty solid, the CAMERA! The camera is out of this world, my wife who uses her S6 to take pictures of everything and anything just fell in love with it so we are buying another one for her. I uploaded a few pics of random things. It's running Android 7.0 flawless, I have TMobile and all I did was put my sim in and I have signal where I couldn't even get 2 cans and a string to work. As fast the gov telling us to not buy this phone...... Yeah, I found no malware so far so I'm not worried. Updating: I want to add this in, screen is actually 5.7\" I installed cpuz to get the true specs because although they advertise 5.9 something isn't feeling right so review the screen shot. UPDATE: Not happy at this moment, I'm getting random pop-up messages/Spam. Which I already had another phone/different mnfg, that did this and it turned out to have viruses in the os. I have a year warranty on this so..... Wish me luck UPDATE: Spoke with tech support...... If I can tell them what the pop-up says they could help me..... It's a pop-up for a quick second and disappears, It's not long enough to read what it's saying. But for some reason the flashlight is consuming data??? Can't disable it either.",

Regardless of whether you turn on/off the auto brightness, certain apps will dim when used. So my home background and google search or some other apps are all bright but when I open my chrome browser, it gets very dimmed. Only way is to up the brightness to full but that also means everytime I come back to other apps or home background, its so bright. After using EMUI for about a week right now, I find more errors than more convenience. This dimming problem and not getting gmail notification are really starting to get on my nerves. So I had to take one more star away. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a good phone under the budget. Everything runs smoothly and camera is actually better than I expected and overall, I can't really complain much because of its great price. However, as someone who has to stay on top of my emails and such for my work, it gets frustrating because getting a notification for my gmails is hit or miss. I also don't get notifications from certain apps but I don't care as much as I care for my emails. I tried looking for battery optimization setting and trying to see if I can excempt it from battery saving etc but no option such as protected apps on this system. Notification is a big, big problem for me and probably lot of people who depend on their phone for work. Other than that, I don't have anything that I dislike about this phone as of yet.",

                "review_text": "If you\u2019re in the market for a new Android smartphone you have a multitude of choices. I recently started having problems with my Galaxy Note Edge (a one-time Samsung flagship) but given that the phone lasted way past its two-year mark, I\u2019d say I got my money\u2019s worth. The biggest factor in my decision making for getting the Huawei Mate Special Edition (SE) was price. It\u2019s hard to swallow paying upwards of $800 to $1,000 for a smartphone that\u2019s one drop away from becoming the worst thing to happen to you all week/month/year. On the other hand, after experimenting with lower-end budget phones (ZTE Maven and Moto G4), I learned that at least with Android, you do get what you pay for. I\u2019m going to start with something a little different from most other reviews: apps I had to replace. Specifically, there were three stock apps that were tripping me up on the Huawei, because they wouldn\u2019t do certain things. I found free replacements for them on the Play Store and I\u2019ve had no problems since the switchovers. \u2022 First the browser: Chrome on the Mate SE is slow and full of ads. I ditched it for (of all things) Samsung\u2019s Internet browser coupled with two extensions for ad blocking (Adblock Fast and Disconnect for Samsung Internet). Much faster and you have the advantage of a home screen of web shortcuts you can create inside the app. \u2022 Next, the music player. For some odd reason, Huawei\u2019s music player doesn\u2019t read pre-made m3u files (these are files for playlists). You can make one on the phone, but if you have ones that were made on a computer, the phone won\u2019t recognize them. Solve it by installing another music player (I used Pi Music Player and it works just fine). \u2022 As for the camera, the dual back facing cameras are pretty capable right out of the box (you will want to play with the photo and video settings to get high quality pictures). But there is one software/app problem that doesn\u2019t affect everyone but will affect some: in video mode, the camera won\u2019t recognize an external microphone. Most smartphones can handle a TRRS microphone (4 \u201cpoles\u201d and three black rings) ; the stock camera app on this phone can't. Solution: download a different camera app. I used Open Camera; to get it to work, in video settings, set the microphone to use external mic when present and you should be good to go. Now the good stuff. Is the Huawei Mate SE a good substitute for a Galaxy Note Edge? Yes. Is it as perfect as the Note Edge was in its hey-day? Nope. Am I much happier with a new Huawei than a three-year old Samsung? Definitely. So let\u2019s start with what\u2019s missing. There\u2019s no NFC, no 5G wi-fi, no removable battery and of course, no S-Pen. I modified my Note Edge to do wireless charging; no bueno trying to do the same thing on the Mate SE. The Mate SE also has a bottom firing speaker that while loud, is kind of weird the first few times you listen to it. Screen resolution on the Mate SE is not as bright and crisp as the Note Edge\u2019s Super AMOLED display (but after a few days you\u2019ll get used to it). What will you NOT get with the Mate SE that you\u2019ll get on other smartphones (some priced the same, some more expensive)? \u2022 No USB-C- Not a deal breaker for me b/c I have a ton of Micro USB chargers and cables lying around (so it\u2019s actually a plus right now). \u2022 No Android 8.0 Oreo- The Mate SE ships with Android 7.0 (Nougat) but since the Mate SE\u2019s sister phone the Honor 7x is now going through beta testing with 8.0, Oreo is probably in the Mate\u2019s very near future. \u2022 No IP68 dust or water resistance- Would have been nice, but nope. So what is there to like? \u2022 Battery life. I run the same exact apps (plus the three substitutes I mentioned) on my Huawei as I did on the Galaxy Note Edge. At the end of the day, the Edge was at about 15% but the Mate SE is at about 50%. The Mate SE has a 3340mAh battery; the Note Edge a 3000mAh battery. Size-wise, it\u2019s not a big difference, but the phone, the processor, and the 7.0 OS versus the 6.0 OS on the Note is obviously much more efficient. Advantage Huawei. \u2022 The fingerprint sensor. THIS THING WILL BLOW YOUR MIND. I\u2019ve used a fingerprint sensor before, but I found it finicky and slow. Not so here: the Mate SE\u2019s sensor is super, super, SUPER fast. Touch it, and you\u2019re in. \u2022 Landscape mode: This is odd- on my Samsung Galaxy Note Edge I could never get the phone to do a decent landscape mode on the home pages. Inside an app, no problem, but on the home screens, it never worked. This phone does landscape on all pages. It\u2019s a little thing, but after missing it for so long, it\u2019s kind of cool. Cool Stuff I\u2019ve not seen before since my last new smartphone three years ago: \u2022 Screenshot scroll. You\u2019ve probably done a screenshot before, but what happens when you want to get an entire page as a screenshot that is longer than what you can see on the screen? Screenshot scroll takes care of that: it\u2019s built-in software that will copy an entire page not just what is displayed on the phone (find it in drop down navigation menu). \u2022 Speaking of the drop down navigation menu, Huawei gives you the ability to add a fourth button for that navigation menu at the bottom of your display. You can program the fingerprint sensor to perform a task by sliding your finger across the sensor (like say opening the camera), blocked numbers can be based on keywords and contacts, and Huawei has a virus scanner baked into the phone under the phone manager app. \u2022 Other goodies: you can encrypt photos and videos as well as lock certain apps so that you (and your fingerprint and nobody else) can use the app. Finally, there\u2019s App Twin- the ability to log into the same app using two different accounts at the same time. two different logins on the same app at the same time. My last comments: troubleshooting some apps. \u2022 If you happen to use Waze with Android Auto, you\u2019re going to have problems with the Mate SE the first time you try it. The fix: go to settings, go to apps, select Android Auto, delete all data including the cache, start Android Auto BEFORE you connect it to the car and go through the permissions. Once done, connect it to the car and you should be good to go. Don\u2019t ask, all I know is it worked for me. \u2022 Two other problems: my Huawei did weird things with my Arlo system. Solved this by actually rebooting the base station. I still haven\u2019t properly figured out why the phone and Wear OS (for smartwatches) isn\u2019t perfect (I had to reboot and start over several times to get watch faces to download. I\u2019ll finish with this: the dumbest thing about this phone (and the nicest!) is the 18x9 display. On most apps it works perfectly fine. On some, a dialogue box pops up asking if you want to go \u201cfull screen.\u201d My answer is always yes and when I hit it, it makes you sometimes start all over again. Huawei- please fix this! It\u2019s the one annoying aspect of your phone that there doesn\u2019t seem to be a quick fix for. Conclusion: if you need a new phone, buy this one. It comes with lots of memory (64GB built in) and lots of operating RAM (4GB). You can pop in a big SD Card (I have a 128GB) or another SIM if you want to go dual-SIM. Is it going to be as good as a flagship phone? No. But are you getting $600-$700 more \u201cumph\u201d in a Note 8, S9, iPhone 8 or iPhone X than you would in a Mate SE? That\u2019s for you to decide. # # #",

More thoughts: the second SIM card has 2G (phone call & message) only; if you have AT&T SIM (2G shutdown), got to set it to main SIM, otherwise no service; all calls and messages have a label of SIM 1 or 2; the clone function makes it very easy to transfer app and data from other phone within same WiFi network by scanning the QR code.",

                "review_text": "Been using this awesome phone now for a week. I will list the pro's and con's of the phone. Pros: 64 GB of internal storage. That is a ton of space for apps you can put on the phone. Pictures and videos also if you don't have a microSD card. Love it. MicroSD card slot. I put in my MicroSD card and for the first time a smart phone that didn't ask to reformat the card and lose all your pictures. That is pretty awesome. Kirin 659 CPU is fast! Octa Core CPU running 4 cores at 2.36 GHZ and 4 Cores at 1.7 GHZ. Every app opens really fast. 4 GB of RAM. I have had up to 20+ apps open at the same time and still had 2 GB free of RAM. No slow down with many apps open with more RAM to spare to open up a bunch more apps. Phone running Nougat 7 Android OS and I heard that Oreo 8 Android will be rolling out to the phone next month in May. That was a big selling point to me to get the latest Android. When I set up my phone it had a update for EMUI and also updated to the latest security updates released by Google Android. Antivirus protection already on the phone out of the box. Avast security is running on the phone! Pretty good antivirus program and didn't have to pay for the antivirus program. Always a plus. I found this by looking through all the settings on the phone. The one speaker sounds pretty good while on the speaker phone or listening to music. Wish it had 2 speakers. I easily connected to my Bluetooth Headset and Bluetooth on my car stereo which sounds really good. The Camera has alot of settings you can change and takes pretty good pictures. For $229 this phone works great. Cons: The only con I find in this phone is wish the battery was bigger. At least a 4000 MAH battery. However I browse the web, check work and personal email, Facebook, google +, listen to Pandora internet radio all day, text, make phone calls, access other apps and still have some battery life at the end of the night before I go to bed. I have always felt that smartphone batteries could be better/bigger but this battery on this phone does its job.",

It has a very nice and bright LED display that gives vibrant colors, it has a very good camera for what you would expect a more mid-range premium smart to have, It sounds decent but it definitely isn't where this smartphone shines. Pros: Very quick Fingerprint sensor Very nice display Decent Speakers Decent Camera Quick Setup Very nice and feels good to hold Full Metal Body Unlocked [GSM Carriers] Very Quick Good Battery life Heavily customize-able Cons: No NFC [No problem for me] Not that great of camera in low light conditions No Type-C Charging No Wireless Charging Bad Speaker placement [Easy to cover up] Heavily Modified Android [I personally like the customization, but it may not be for you, otherwise, get a launcher that you like] [But what do you expect? Its a $230 phone that beats most premium phones in a lot of ways, Plus a lot of the cons are things that people can easily go without. I would highly recommend this phone]",

The display is edge to edge (left to right), the body is unibody aluminum, the fit and finish is great, the fingerprint reader is amazingly fast, and the performance is really fast. They also give you a free clear case that fits well. I have the Huawei noise canceling earbuds, but they don't charge via the phone headphone jack, like it does on older Huawei phones. I am not a power user of a phone, but I am impressed with the Huawei quality/performance for the price. Setup is easy, you run a Huawei cloning app on your old phone, and it transfers data and apps to the new phone vis Bluetooth. Compared to aluminum iPhone, the antenna lines on the back look much nicer, and the blend into the case much better.",

I ended up returning it though because for me coming from a Samsung Galaxy S4 I just found the phone to be to a bit too bit. It's more than 1/2 inch longer than the Galaxy S4 and it's also a bit wider. After just a few days, I found my hands a bit tired of holding the phone as it's also heavier and tired because of the slightly more reach in order to text with it quickly. I want to emphasize this really is a great phone for the price. Best I have seen but keep in mind when you're purchasing a new phone than form factor is something you should also think about. After having this phone, I have to say that Huawei makes a great product.",

The other major issue is when you're at work can you multimedia So that you'll hear your phone ring if someone calls but not here getting notifications and other stuff. Everything comes through the phone profile so you're going to always hear your games notifications and other stuff. The only way to do fix that is to mute phone but then you'll never hear your phone ring if you really need to. This also only has one speaker so it's not stereo. I had contacted the company and they said that this is there practice on this phone that everything plays through the ringer volume. So you even if you're on the phone and a game or message comes through it will play as if that person has it on their phone in this playing it at that time. Don't get this phone if you keep your phone on at a job and keep the ringer on to hear if an emergency. Because everything plays through the ringer messages games everything",

The sub 250 market isn't that great nowadays, but this little gem popped out at me at best buy. One left in the whole of Chicago, managed to snag last one, and I'm super impressed. Battery life is all day and more, performance is way above 250 dollars worth but don't expect Galaxy levels. Screen is great, software is much much better, but still needs work.

                "review_text": "The Mate SE is built very, very, well - it definitely feels like a premium phone and is an incredible value. Sticking with industrial design, the weakest points of the Mate SE are the front-facing logo (seriously, why? put a logo on the rear if you must), and the screen. The screen has a slight bit of grain to it. The grain is most visible on white content, e.g. in Google Now or if you open a new tab in Chrome. Might not be an issue for some. The WORST thing about the SE is the software. It only ships with android 7.0, and EMUI is *awful*. I installed Nova, and even tried out a few EMUI themes to try and get the quick settings & settings menu to be more like stock Android. Then I found that Huawei had also replaced Android's standard 'share' menu (e.g. when one shares a photo from Google Photos to WhatsApp) with their own inferior version. Huawei: please join the 'android one' program, and ship stock Android on your phones. This will also make it easier for you to provide OS updates for your phones. If the Mate SE had stock Android, it would be fantastic. I can't accept EMUI though, and have returned the phone as a consequence. I highly recommend that anyone considering this phone purchase the Xiaomi Mi A1 instead - that's what I did. The Mi A1's build quality is excellent, it has no front-facing logo, and it is part of the android one initiative, running stock Android 8.0 - it is incredible. (It does have larger top & bottom bezels than the Mate SE, but in all other aspects the Xiaomi Mi A1 is better, or at least as good.) Do NOT buy the Mate SE - get the Xiaomi Mi A1! https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Android-Cameras-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B076HQ6FSY/",

I've not used androids before and a lot of the apps that I wanted to use were available like whatsapp, fitbit. However, the phone is really slow - I read that it might be because the wifi and bluetooth use the same antenna. I will try it but whatsapp video calling was an absolute nightmare with this phone - constant lag. And I also just learnt today that fitbit is not compatible with Huawei phones due to the some issue with their bluetooth and apple earphones don't work with thhs. So it depends on what you're used to and what you are using your phone for- apps that are fairly common may not work well (if they work at all) with this phone.

                "review_text": "Update: I am changing the review to 5 stars. After few more days of use: the 6x clearly outranks the 5x in design (which is growing on me), WiFi and cell reception, performance and battery life. Honor 5x was the first true \u201cbudget\u201d smart phone. Metal design and fingerprint sensor where rarely seen on any phone with close price tag at that time, are becoming more and more standard now. That being said that device had some shortfalls. The performance with the snapdragon was lacking under pressure and the EMUI android skin is not everybody\u2019s cup of tea. Today we look at the true successor of the Honor 5x with similar price tag. How did the devices rank against each other? And are the differences worth the extra $80 or so? (Both available on Amazon now for $249 vs $169) Un-boxing and accessories Pretty standard boxes with nothing fancy for both. Accessories much easier to find for 5x but 6x is just launched so I am sure it will catch up. Not much to talk about here. Design Both are gorgeous. I had the gold Honor 5x and now compared to the gray Honor 6x, they both look way much more premium than their price tag. You could easily mistake them for a $600 phone. That being said the Honor 6x is more round around the edges, has more mate finish on the back (both has aluminum body) and feels more comfortable to hold. Honor did improve the design but not much. Honor 6x still is marginally better. Processor, RAM and performance Honor 5x had the more widely known Snapdragon 617, while Honor opted for the in house Kirin 655. Honor 5x had 2 GB of RAM and 6x has 3 GB (in USA anyway). On paper, the Kirin outperforms the Snapdragon (it is actually more in line with Snapdragon 625-650). This is confirmed by multiple benchmark tests although I will not bore you with the details (easily obtainable by googling both processors). Kirin also seems more power efficient thanks to the more semiconductor size (28 nm vs 16 nm) which should translate into more less heat generation as well. How did this translate into real life performance? Both devices perform well for everyday use. You will notice a slight hiccups here and there for the honor 5x particularly when opening apps (Google maps seems to take few seconds) and this becomes more prominent when you install more apps (I had 100+ apps installed). The 6x seems to handle this much better. The lag is almost non-existent and apps open up quickly (even google maps! I hated those extra seconds of waiting on 5x when checking traffic in the morning before I head to work \u2013 no more with 6x!). Is it the new processor? Is the extra RAM? Being an in house chipset optimized more to work with the user interface? Or is it simply that devices become slower with time and the 6x will follow lead? Could be any of those, but for the time being I have to go with the 6x as a winner! One last word: my only concern regarding the 6x is the GPU (which handles the display and 3d part, gaming mostly). The GPU on the 5x is Adreno 405 \u2013 no match for much better GPUs in today\u2019s flagships but performs OK and tried in and out. The Mali T830MP2 is not as much. They both seem to handle things comparably now but will see how the Mali handles games released a year or two from now. Screen Both are gorgeous. Is this the best screen around? No. but for practical purposes both did great with a small edge for the 6x, colors seems more accurate. However, for the price range they may be the best you can get and it looks amazing for watching a movie or displaying pictures. Given the slightly higher price tag for he 6x, I would say this is a tie. Camera Both perform adequately. Both are poor in low light situations. Both will take OK pictures. Did the two lens format in the 6x make a huge difference? In my personal opinion, no. The second Camera is not a monochrome camera like you see in pricier phones, and mostly functions to give that nice background blurring but not much more. This seems odd as the two lens format seems to be a selling point to Honor but the phone has more to offer anyway. This is a tie. Software This is where it gets messy. You will always hear bad things about EMUI. Let me get out of the way: It is not as bad as people make it look like. It is just different. It is somewhere in the middle of Android and iPhone and I think it took some nice features from both (I like that you can search for apps simply by swiping the home screen down like you can do on iOS). You still get the customizations of android, you get the widgets and you get the ability to run 3rd party launcher (Nova launcher seemed to make my honor 5x faster). But it is not stock android. If you like android as it is, do not go for this one. If you don\u2019t mind Honor tweaks then I think you will do fine with both. For what it is worth, I think the EMUI is one of the best android skins to prevent battery drains \u2013 it seems well optimized. As far as comparing the two devices: while it is disappointing that Honor 6x launched with EMUI 4 on android M, we are promised an update to Android N with EMUI within weeks. Honor kept their word re updating the 5x from android 5 to 6 so hopefully they will keep their track record. This is also a tie. Battery Honor 5x best selling point for me was the battery. No, it will not last 2 days, 3 days or longer. No you will not get 10 hours of screen on time. But that is not what I am looking for in a phone. I am looking for a phone that can give me few hours (3-5 at least of screen on time) to check my emails and browse internet, may be the occasional game or two, and not drain itself to death when I am not using it. Basically I want a phone I can use moderately with no need to charge mid day. You would think this is easy to get but to me it was not. I tried several phones at this price range and higher since my nexus 4 died. I tried Lg g2, xperia z1 and z2, nexus 6p (yes), note 4 and Axon 7. They all had one issue or the other. My biggest problem that I do not get good reception in my work area where I spend several hours a day and this seems to suck the life out of every battery I tried. My phone would go from 100 in the morning to 40 or so while not being used but rarely. Not with Honor 5x. I finally would be able to go home with 50 \u2013 60% + when I get home with moderate usage and 2-3 hours screen on time. It may be the software or the way honor handles the bad reception but that was why I stuck with the 5x for a year. Honor 6x seems to follow lead as well and I have no issues using it for 2 days with light use. It also lacks true quick charging but it charged to 100% in about two hours. At the price range I really do not care about the extra 30 min it seems to take when compared to, say, Axon 7 which took me around an hour and a half to fully charge. So far both devices perform well. A slight edge for honor 6x. Miscellaneous They both have fingerprint scanner. For all intents and purposes is it excellent and it does not get much better than this. I cannot remember last time I had to try more than once to open the device. It works while screen is off (unlike older Samsung models where screen had to be turned on manually first). The honor 6x sensor is faster than the 5x Both are fully compatible with T mobile and AT and T. LTE is excellent: I get around 10-15 mg download speed in a major metro area. It does have band 12 on t mobile Both have double sim, the second sim doubles as an SD card slot in both 6x is reported to have an IR port but I am unable to get it to work yet! no built in remote control app. Both have the much more available USB 2 for a charger. While this may become problematic years from now for the time being, to me, this an advantage. You can use any old android charger with no need for adapters Verdict This is an excellent phone. I am really happy that so called mid-range phones are getting better and better each year. It will not disappoint you and will perform more than adequately for everyday use and then some more. After few more days of use the much better battery life, design and performance easily justifies the price difference. Good work Huawei!",

Go For It!!!*** This is a very good device. I was looking for a new phone because the screen of my entry level LG X Power was cracked to hell. My budget of around $100 had me looking at yet more budget phones from my carrier. 16 gigs of storage, 2 gigs of RAM, larger but mediocre screens, average chipsets, plastic build all around. I shopped here and stumbled across this phone for $200 and thought it a good deal but still twice my phone budget. Came back a few days later and stumbled upon a Flash Sale that saw this phone priced at $150 for $30 dollars a month on my Amazon card and considering all the strong reviews I thought it a no brainer purchase. So glad I got it. Even at $200 regular price it is totally worth it in my opinion. It is a top quality product in its midrange segment. I am not tech savvy with phones so will keep this simple. It has a very good screen with high resolution and good pixel density. Colors are accurate and well saturated. Photos, video, and text are very clear and sharp. The screen appears three times brighter then my X Power at 100% brightness. Battery life is formidable, out gunning my old phone even though that phone has a higher capacity battery. After 5 hours of onscreen time and various app usage at 100% brightness the phone was still at 25% battery life from 100%. It does not have a quick charger but its high capacity battery charges fairly quickly nonetheless. From 15% with the included \"brick\" charger the battery was at 65% in under an hour and ready to roll again. It feels quality right out of the box. The rear cover (it is not unibody as some have said) is made from aluminum and feels good in hand. The phone has a substantial feel to it. The android OS mated to Honors own UI operates fluidly and apps open and run smoothly. The look and design of the phone has nothing cheap about it and while it is not a high end or premium design it won't embarrass itself beside the typical iphone, etc. It looks nice and does not look like a pig wearing lipstick. Indeed it is attractive in its own right. You can hand this phone over for use to anyone and they would think \"feels good, looks good.\" If it were a car it wouldn't be a 7 Series BMW but hey, a 4 Series is nothing to sneeze at. The camera is very good, and great in its segment. Lots of functions and features I have not even explored yet, but shots taken out of the box in all manner of lighting conditions are of good quality, clarity, and color so far. Call quality is very good and I noticed this difference immediately. No matter what sort of phone the person on the other end is using I can hear them clearly and without muffling or breaking up. Even if they are whispering. Unlike all the entry level phones I have used where I seemed to always be saying 'I can't hear you' and 'I can't understand what you are saying' with this phone I can hear the person talking almost as if they are sitting beside me. Connectivity has been excellent be it data, wifi, or bluetooth. Always strong and well connected with no \"drops\" or hiccups. That's about it. If I knew then what I know now about this phone after a week of usage I would have happily paid full retail for it and felt it a very good deal. It is \"budget\" only in price in my opinion. I will never go back to entry level phones again and may even stay loyal to this brand after learning more about the company and it's products. If you have doubts just research Huawei / Honor on the internet. Huawei is a major player in the global marketplace and competes very well in the flagship phone market. Honor is their sub brand used to sell high quality midrange phones. A Chinese company, yes. But don't be mislead by that. This is not a \"knock off\" brand or maker of cheap, disposable products. This is the real deal, folks. And if looking to \"move up\" from entry level in my opinion, at this price point and for what you get, is hard to beat. Oh, and it's unlocked. Which means when you get your service you get it without carrier branding or bloatware. You just get the phone / data service. The software installed remains unchanged and unaltered, which makes the phone feel more personal and uncluttered. It's a nice phone.",

                "review_text": "I started as an iPhone user, but I have been frustrated over the degrading quality of Apple products ever since Steve Jobs died. Believe me, I never had to reboot my iPhone before, but now I have to do it once every month or so. My review will mostly focus on the migration from iPhone 6S to Huawei Honor 6X. (1) Most apps I had on my iPhone, I can find them in Google Play Store. The migration of contact book is seamless. Once I signed into my Google account to my Honor 6X, all my contacts were imported automatically. I didn't have to anything. I spent some time researching an Email app that most resembled the iPhone email app, but eventually decided to use the default Huawei email app. Now I am gradually used to it. Maybe the one thing I miss is the Notes app. I took some notes using this app with different email accounts, but some do not show up in my email account somehow. (2) The battery life of Honor 6X beats the iPhone 6S easily. I used to charge after lunch and charge again before sleep. Now my phone lasts a whole day with the same usage frequency. I am very happy with it. (3) Camera quality is excellent on this Honor 6X. I haven't used it a lot, but there are definitely more functions, such as the Pro Photo/Video mode. I probably won't be using it, but someone might appreciate this feature. (4) Fingerprint reader is excellent compared with the iPhone. After having used the Honor 6X for a few days, I find it so much more convenient to do things such as closing an app, login to the phone. I used to use the fingerprint reader to login to my bank account apps on my iPhone, but most Android apps don't support login using fingerprint yet. (Correction: I stand corrected: Most apps do support fingerprint login with a few exceptions, one being the Fidelity app). (5) The dual SIM feature on this phone is very appreciated. I somehow got the impression that it supports the second SIM slot and SD card simultaneously, but it does not. And only nano size SIMS are allowed in both slots. I had to cut my second SIM from micro to nano. (6) I had Apple pay setup on my iPhone, but I have never had a chance to use it. So I am not missing that feature on the Honor 6X, which does not support NFC. Overall, I find it quite easy to make the transition from being an iPhone user to an Adroid user with Huawei Honor 6X.",

                "review_text": "For more coverage of this device and other similar devices check out my YouTube Channel linked in my profile. The Honor 6X is a phone that easily outperforms it's price. As a person who owns and reviews many different phones throughout a year, I have zero hesitations in recommending the Honor 6X to anyone considering a mid-range/budget device at the beginning of 2017. This phone is by no means perfect, but it does so many things well that in some regards you would expect it to have a more premium price. I've now had my Honor 6X for 5 days, and here are my thoughts so far (Note: my video review was from day 3 of ownership): Performance: 5/5 - The Honor 6X is being run by the Kirin 655 processor with 3gb of RAM, and it is a very snappy combination. To be honest I can't tell any difference in day to day performance of this phone with other much more expensive phones that I have used and reviewed. If you are in to benchmarks, the 6X scored a multi-score of right around 3200. Putting that aside, I can assure you that this phone will not feel like a budget phone in terms of its performance. Build Quality: 5/5 - The Honor 6X is a very beautiful device that honestly looks like it could be a far more expensive device. It's all metal backing gives it a very premium feel and look. Cameras: 4.8/5 - The dual cameras set upon the rear of the phone do an awesome job in both low light and of course in good lighting conditions as well. The cameras are 12mp and 2mp, and one very cool feature is that they allow you to make focal adjustments in the post-processing of the photo. In other words, you can take a photo of an object and blur out the background to give it a DSLR-like appearance to the photo. The 8mp camera also takes very solid selfie photos, but for me the rear cameras are a huge selling point of this budget device. Battery Life: 4.5/5 - The 3340 mAh battery of the Honor 6X is an all day battery. For even a heavy user like me I was able to pretty easily get through a full day and still have around 20-30% battery. In general I'm getting around 4.5 - 5.5 hours of screen on time, but it's more useful to note that this phone will get almost any user through a full day. It should also be mentioned that the Honor 6X is a \"fast charging\" phone as well. It takes around 90 minutes for me to get a full charge. Screen Quality: 4.8/5 - I've heard other YouTubers mention that the screen on the Honor 6X seems washed out, but I can tell you with confidence that the screen looks great, and it also gets bright enough to see in direct sunlight. It is a 1080p screen at 403 ppi, and for the average phone user, this pixel density is more than enough. What's missing: The Honor 6X doesn't have NFC, and it also doesn't have support for dual band wi-fi. Most home wifi users are not on dual band wifi, but if you are, you will need to use 2.4ghz for the Honor 6X. Another negative is that the Honor 6X is using a slightly outdated charging cord with micro usb. This is probably what most phones out there are still using, but Type C is shipping out on even a lot of budget friendly devices now, so it's surprising that the Honor 6X doesn't use Type C. Conclusion: I have absolutely no reservations in recommending the Honor 6X. It is a fantastic budget device that cuts very few corners to be at this low of a price point.",

I was using a Lumix 640xl Windows phone before. The only thing I miss about my Windows phone is Cortana. Honor can you make me a Cortana assistant for EMUI 5.0??? Okay now onto the phone. First I love the fingerprint reader. The placement is great and it works great. The cameras work fine for me, they aren't equivalent to my Nikon DSLR, but who cares it's a phone not a professional camera. The dual rear cameras are neat, but I haven't really found much use for the bokeh effect. The screen is much better than my old phone, sure it's not 4K UHD, but again it's a phone not a theater screen. The RAM so far has been more than sufficient, the phone operates at a speed that I would expect from any phone. Personally I don't worry about the benchmark tests, but they are pretty good if that's something you care about. The battery is great! Two days of normal use without having to charge. I was a bit put off by some of the issues with EMUI 4.0, but I ignored them am happy to report that EMUI 5.0 is much better. The fit and finish of this phone are excellent, much better than what I expect from a $250 phone. It doesn't have the 5 GHz WiFi, but I never noticed a lag when on WiFi. It also doesn't have NFC, but I took this as a plus. I have never used it and I don't like the idea of someone being able to access my banking information via my phone. If you have a need for two sims (I don't), keep in mind you won't be able to install a micro SD card, and sim 2 and the micro SD card use the same slot. I forgot to mention at the beginning, the packaging was very nice. No huge bells and whistles, but that didn't bother me. If I want all that I will waist an extra $500 on a phone. All things considered I am very happy that I chose the Honor 6x and in a few years I can't wait to see what Huawei comes up with.",

I thought with going with another Samsung but I had been doing a lot of research and I did not want to be locked into another monthly payment. This scored good reviews with the Amazon reviews as well as the other Tech sites. Pros: 1. $199 for a solid phone is an incredible price. 2. I like the screen size even though my S6 + was bigger ( I never cared for the curved edges on the Samsung) 3. Resolution is good on this price range. 4. Expandable storage (done away with on S6 +...hated it!) 5. 3 GB of RAM is ample to handle most things. I am not a game addict so it suites me well. 6. NO BLOATWARE. You install all the applications you want ....not the carriers applications. 7. Sound for calls and receiving are good. 8. Awesome battery life. 8 hours and still at 94%. That's just checking email and texts and an occasional call. 9. Lightning fast fingerprint reader Cons: 1. Speaker is thin sounding but I am an audiophile and I always use ear buds or my Bose. Not a deal breaker. 2. The initial layout of the screens was a little challenging to get something functional. 3. Pictures are not horrible but not even close to what my Samsung could snap. 4. Installation of applications is a little laggy. 5. Screen is cheap and it dulls the resolution a little.",

                "review_text": "Update: I am changing the review to 5 stars. After few more days of use: the 6x clearly outranks the 5x in design (which is growing on me), WiFi and cell reception, performance and battery life. Honor 5x was the first true \u201cbudget\u201d smart phone. Metal design and fingerprint sensor where rarely seen on any phone with close price tag at that time, are becoming more and more standard now. That being said that device had some shortfalls. The performance with the snapdragon was lacking under pressure and the EMUI android skin is not everybody\u2019s cup of tea. Today we look at the true successor of the Honor 5x with similar price tag. How did the devices rank against each other? And are the differences worth the extra $80 or so? (Both available on Amazon now for $249 vs $169) Un-boxing and accessories Pretty standard boxes with nothing fancy for both. Accessories much easier to find for 5x but 6x is just launched so I am sure it will catch up. Not much to talk about here. Design Both are gorgeous. I had the gold Honor 5x and now compared to the gray Honor 6x, they both look way much more premium than their price tag. You could easily mistake them for a $600 phone. That being said the Honor 6x is more round around the edges, has more mate finish on the back (both has aluminum body) and feels more comfortable to hold. Honor did improve the design but not much. Honor 6x still is marginally better. Processor, RAM and performance Honor 5x had the more widely known Snapdragon 617, while Honor opted for the in house Kirin 655. Honor 5x had 2 GB of RAM and 6x has 3 GB (in USA anyway). On paper, the Kirin outperforms the Snapdragon (it is actually more in line with Snapdragon 625-650). This is confirmed by multiple benchmark tests although I will not bore you with the details (easily obtainable by googling both processors). Kirin also seems more power efficient thanks to the more semiconductor size (28 nm vs 16 nm) which should translate into more less heat generation as well. How did this translate into real life performance? Both devices perform well for everyday use. You will notice a slight hiccups here and there for the honor 5x particularly when opening apps (Google maps seems to take few seconds) and this becomes more prominent when you install more apps (I had 100+ apps installed). The 6x seems to handle this much better. The lag is almost non-existent and apps open up quickly (even google maps! I hated those extra seconds of waiting on 5x when checking traffic in the morning before I head to work \u2013 no more with 6x!). Is it the new processor? Is the extra RAM? Being an in house chipset optimized more to work with the user interface? Or is it simply that devices become slower with time and the 6x will follow lead? Could be any of those, but for the time being I have to go with the 6x as a winner! One last word: my only concern regarding the 6x is the GPU (which handles the display and 3d part, gaming mostly). The GPU on the 5x is Adreno 405 \u2013 no match for much better GPUs in today\u2019s flagships but performs OK and tried in and out. The Mali T830MP2 is not as much. They both seem to handle things comparably now but will see how the Mali handles games released a year or two from now. Screen Both are gorgeous. Is this the best screen around? No. but for practical purposes both did great with a small edge for the 6x, colors seems more accurate. However, for the price range they may be the best you can get and it looks amazing for watching a movie or displaying pictures. Given the slightly higher price tag for he 6x, I would say this is a tie. Camera Both perform adequately. Both are poor in low light situations. Both will take OK pictures. Did the two lens format in the 6x make a huge difference? In my personal opinion, no. The second Camera is not a monochrome camera like you see in pricier phones, and mostly functions to give that nice background blurring but not much more. This seems odd as the two lens format seems to be a selling point to Honor but the phone has more to offer anyway. This is a tie. Software This is where it gets messy. You will always hear bad things about EMUI. Let me get out of the way: It is not as bad as people make it look like. It is just different. It is somewhere in the middle of Android and iPhone and I think it took some nice features from both (I like that you can search for apps simply by swiping the home screen down like you can do on iOS). You still get the customizations of android, you get the widgets and you get the ability to run 3rd party launcher (Nova launcher seemed to make my honor 5x faster). But it is not stock android. If you like android as it is, do not go for this one. If you don\u2019t mind Honor tweaks then I think you will do fine with both. For what it is worth, I think the EMUI is one of the best android skins to prevent battery drains \u2013 it seems well optimized. As far as comparing the two devices: while it is disappointing that Honor 6x launched with EMUI 4 on android M, we are promised an update to Android N with EMUI within weeks. Honor kept their word re updating the 5x from android 5 to 6 so hopefully they will keep their track record. This is also a tie. Battery Honor 5x best selling point for me was the battery. No, it will not last 2 days, 3 days or longer. No you will not get 10 hours of screen on time. But that is not what I am looking for in a phone. I am looking for a phone that can give me few hours (3-5 at least of screen on time) to check my emails and browse internet, may be the occasional game or two, and not drain itself to death when I am not using it. Basically I want a phone I can use moderately with no need to charge mid day. You would think this is easy to get but to me it was not. I tried several phones at this price range and higher since my nexus 4 died. I tried Lg g2, xperia z1 and z2, nexus 6p (yes), note 4 and Axon 7. They all had one issue or the other. My biggest problem that I do not get good reception in my work area where I spend several hours a day and this seems to suck the life out of every battery I tried. My phone would go from 100 in the morning to 40 or so while not being used but rarely. Not with Honor 5x. I finally would be able to go home with 50 \u2013 60% + when I get home with moderate usage and 2-3 hours screen on time. It may be the software or the way honor handles the bad reception but that was why I stuck with the 5x for a year. Honor 6x seems to follow lead as well and I have no issues using it for 2 days with light use. It also lacks true quick charging but it charged to 100% in about two hours. At the price range I really do not care about the extra 30 min it seems to take when compared to, say, Axon 7 which took me around an hour and a half to fully charge. So far both devices perform well. A slight edge for honor 6x. Miscellaneous They both have fingerprint scanner. For all intents and purposes is it excellent and it does not get much better than this. I cannot remember last time I had to try more than once to open the device. It works while screen is off (unlike older Samsung models where screen had to be turned on manually first). The honor 6x sensor is faster than the 5x Both are fully compatible with T mobile and AT and T. LTE is excellent: I get around 10-15 mg download speed in a major metro area. It does have band 12 on t mobile Both have double sim, the second sim doubles as an SD card slot in both 6x is reported to have an IR port but I am unable to get it to work yet! no built in remote control app. Both have the much more available USB 2 for a charger. While this may become problematic years from now for the time being, to me, this an advantage. You can use any old android charger with no need for adapters Verdict This is an excellent phone. I am really happy that so called mid-range phones are getting better and better each year. It will not disappoint you and will perform more than adequately for everyday use and then some more. After few more days of use the much better battery life, design and performance easily justifies the price difference. Good work Huawei!",

Go For It!!!*** This is a very good device. I was looking for a new phone because the screen of my entry level LG X Power was cracked to hell. My budget of around $100 had me looking at yet more budget phones from my carrier. 16 gigs of storage, 2 gigs of RAM, larger but mediocre screens, average chipsets, plastic build all around. I shopped here and stumbled across this phone for $200 and thought it a good deal but still twice my phone budget. Came back a few days later and stumbled upon a Flash Sale that saw this phone priced at $150 for $30 dollars a month on my Amazon card and considering all the strong reviews I thought it a no brainer purchase. So glad I got it. Even at $200 regular price it is totally worth it in my opinion. It is a top quality product in its midrange segment. I am not tech savvy with phones so will keep this simple. It has a very good screen with high resolution and good pixel density. Colors are accurate and well saturated. Photos, video, and text are very clear and sharp. The screen appears three times brighter then my X Power at 100% brightness. Battery life is formidable, out gunning my old phone even though that phone has a higher capacity battery. After 5 hours of onscreen time and various app usage at 100% brightness the phone was still at 25% battery life from 100%. It does not have a quick charger but its high capacity battery charges fairly quickly nonetheless. From 15% with the included \"brick\" charger the battery was at 65% in under an hour and ready to roll again. It feels quality right out of the box. The rear cover (it is not unibody as some have said) is made from aluminum and feels good in hand. The phone has a substantial feel to it. The android OS mated to Honors own UI operates fluidly and apps open and run smoothly. The look and design of the phone has nothing cheap about it and while it is not a high end or premium design it won't embarrass itself beside the typical iphone, etc. It looks nice and does not look like a pig wearing lipstick. Indeed it is attractive in its own right. You can hand this phone over for use to anyone and they would think \"feels good, looks good.\" If it were a car it wouldn't be a 7 Series BMW but hey, a 4 Series is nothing to sneeze at. The camera is very good, and great in its segment. Lots of functions and features I have not even explored yet, but shots taken out of the box in all manner of lighting conditions are of good quality, clarity, and color so far. Call quality is very good and I noticed this difference immediately. No matter what sort of phone the person on the other end is using I can hear them clearly and without muffling or breaking up. Even if they are whispering. Unlike all the entry level phones I have used where I seemed to always be saying 'I can't hear you' and 'I can't understand what you are saying' with this phone I can hear the person talking almost as if they are sitting beside me. Connectivity has been excellent be it data, wifi, or bluetooth. Always strong and well connected with no \"drops\" or hiccups. That's about it. If I knew then what I know now about this phone after a week of usage I would have happily paid full retail for it and felt it a very good deal. It is \"budget\" only in price in my opinion. I will never go back to entry level phones again and may even stay loyal to this brand after learning more about the company and it's products. If you have doubts just research Huawei / Honor on the internet. Huawei is a major player in the global marketplace and competes very well in the flagship phone market. Honor is their sub brand used to sell high quality midrange phones. A Chinese company, yes. But don't be mislead by that. This is not a \"knock off\" brand or maker of cheap, disposable products. This is the real deal, folks. And if looking to \"move up\" from entry level in my opinion, at this price point and for what you get, is hard to beat. Oh, and it's unlocked. Which means when you get your service you get it without carrier branding or bloatware. You just get the phone / data service. The software installed remains unchanged and unaltered, which makes the phone feel more personal and uncluttered. It's a nice phone.",

                "review_text": "I started as an iPhone user, but I have been frustrated over the degrading quality of Apple products ever since Steve Jobs died. Believe me, I never had to reboot my iPhone before, but now I have to do it once every month or so. My review will mostly focus on the migration from iPhone 6S to Huawei Honor 6X. (1) Most apps I had on my iPhone, I can find them in Google Play Store. The migration of contact book is seamless. Once I signed into my Google account to my Honor 6X, all my contacts were imported automatically. I didn't have to anything. I spent some time researching an Email app that most resembled the iPhone email app, but eventually decided to use the default Huawei email app. Now I am gradually used to it. Maybe the one thing I miss is the Notes app. I took some notes using this app with different email accounts, but some do not show up in my email account somehow. (2) The battery life of Honor 6X beats the iPhone 6S easily. I used to charge after lunch and charge again before sleep. Now my phone lasts a whole day with the same usage frequency. I am very happy with it. (3) Camera quality is excellent on this Honor 6X. I haven't used it a lot, but there are definitely more functions, such as the Pro Photo/Video mode. I probably won't be using it, but someone might appreciate this feature. (4) Fingerprint reader is excellent compared with the iPhone. After having used the Honor 6X for a few days, I find it so much more convenient to do things such as closing an app, login to the phone. I used to use the fingerprint reader to login to my bank account apps on my iPhone, but most Android apps don't support login using fingerprint yet. (Correction: I stand corrected: Most apps do support fingerprint login with a few exceptions, one being the Fidelity app). (5) The dual SIM feature on this phone is very appreciated. I somehow got the impression that it supports the second SIM slot and SD card simultaneously, but it does not. And only nano size SIMS are allowed in both slots. I had to cut my second SIM from micro to nano. (6) I had Apple pay setup on my iPhone, but I have never had a chance to use it. So I am not missing that feature on the Honor 6X, which does not support NFC. Overall, I find it quite easy to make the transition from being an iPhone user to an Adroid user with Huawei Honor 6X.",

                "review_text": "For more coverage of this device and other similar devices check out my YouTube Channel linked in my profile. The Honor 6X is a phone that easily outperforms it's price. As a person who owns and reviews many different phones throughout a year, I have zero hesitations in recommending the Honor 6X to anyone considering a mid-range/budget device at the beginning of 2017. This phone is by no means perfect, but it does so many things well that in some regards you would expect it to have a more premium price. I've now had my Honor 6X for 5 days, and here are my thoughts so far (Note: my video review was from day 3 of ownership): Performance: 5/5 - The Honor 6X is being run by the Kirin 655 processor with 3gb of RAM, and it is a very snappy combination. To be honest I can't tell any difference in day to day performance of this phone with other much more expensive phones that I have used and reviewed. If you are in to benchmarks, the 6X scored a multi-score of right around 3200. Putting that aside, I can assure you that this phone will not feel like a budget phone in terms of its performance. Build Quality: 5/5 - The Honor 6X is a very beautiful device that honestly looks like it could be a far more expensive device. It's all metal backing gives it a very premium feel and look. Cameras: 4.8/5 - The dual cameras set upon the rear of the phone do an awesome job in both low light and of course in good lighting conditions as well. The cameras are 12mp and 2mp, and one very cool feature is that they allow you to make focal adjustments in the post-processing of the photo. In other words, you can take a photo of an object and blur out the background to give it a DSLR-like appearance to the photo. The 8mp camera also takes very solid selfie photos, but for me the rear cameras are a huge selling point of this budget device. Battery Life: 4.5/5 - The 3340 mAh battery of the Honor 6X is an all day battery. For even a heavy user like me I was able to pretty easily get through a full day and still have around 20-30% battery. In general I'm getting around 4.5 - 5.5 hours of screen on time, but it's more useful to note that this phone will get almost any user through a full day. It should also be mentioned that the Honor 6X is a \"fast charging\" phone as well. It takes around 90 minutes for me to get a full charge. Screen Quality: 4.8/5 - I've heard other YouTubers mention that the screen on the Honor 6X seems washed out, but I can tell you with confidence that the screen looks great, and it also gets bright enough to see in direct sunlight. It is a 1080p screen at 403 ppi, and for the average phone user, this pixel density is more than enough. What's missing: The Honor 6X doesn't have NFC, and it also doesn't have support for dual band wi-fi. Most home wifi users are not on dual band wifi, but if you are, you will need to use 2.4ghz for the Honor 6X. Another negative is that the Honor 6X is using a slightly outdated charging cord with micro usb. This is probably what most phones out there are still using, but Type C is shipping out on even a lot of budget friendly devices now, so it's surprising that the Honor 6X doesn't use Type C. Conclusion: I have absolutely no reservations in recommending the Honor 6X. It is a fantastic budget device that cuts very few corners to be at this low of a price point.",

I was using a Lumix 640xl Windows phone before. The only thing I miss about my Windows phone is Cortana. Honor can you make me a Cortana assistant for EMUI 5.0??? Okay now onto the phone. First I love the fingerprint reader. The placement is great and it works great. The cameras work fine for me, they aren't equivalent to my Nikon DSLR, but who cares it's a phone not a professional camera. The dual rear cameras are neat, but I haven't really found much use for the bokeh effect. The screen is much better than my old phone, sure it's not 4K UHD, but again it's a phone not a theater screen. The RAM so far has been more than sufficient, the phone operates at a speed that I would expect from any phone. Personally I don't worry about the benchmark tests, but they are pretty good if that's something you care about. The battery is great! Two days of normal use without having to charge. I was a bit put off by some of the issues with EMUI 4.0, but I ignored them am happy to report that EMUI 5.0 is much better. The fit and finish of this phone are excellent, much better than what I expect from a $250 phone. It doesn't have the 5 GHz WiFi, but I never noticed a lag when on WiFi. It also doesn't have NFC, but I took this as a plus. I have never used it and I don't like the idea of someone being able to access my banking information via my phone. If you have a need for two sims (I don't), keep in mind you won't be able to install a micro SD card, and sim 2 and the micro SD card use the same slot. I forgot to mention at the beginning, the packaging was very nice. No huge bells and whistles, but that didn't bother me. If I want all that I will waist an extra $500 on a phone. All things considered I am very happy that I chose the Honor 6x and in a few years I can't wait to see what Huawei comes up with.",

This scored good reviews with the Amazon reviews as well as the other Tech sites. Pros: 1. $199 for a solid phone is an incredible price. 2. I like the screen size even though my S6 + was bigger ( I never cared for the curved edges on the Samsung) 3. Resolution is good on this price range. 4. Expandable storage (done away with on S6 +...hated it!) 5. 3 GB of RAM is ample to handle most things. I am not a game addict so it suites me well. 6. NO BLOATWARE.

That's just checking email and texts and an occasional call. 9. Lightning fast fingerprint reader Cons: 1. Speaker is thin sounding but I am an audiophile and I always use ear buds or my Bose. Not a deal breaker. 2. The initial layout of the screens was a little challenging to get something functional. 3. Pictures are not horrible but not even close to what my Samsung could snap. 4. Installation of applications is a little laggy. 5. Screen is cheap and it dulls the resolution a little.",

                "review_text": "First, let me say, that I'm retired and on a fixed income. After a lot of research, I finally decided on the Honor 6x. It's not a \"flagship\" but for the extremely reasonable price, it offers an excellent value. I used to work in hi-tech but was unfortunately sidelined due to an unfortunate medical disability. But I love to keep up regularly with what's going on in the field. Therefore, I have a fairly good knowledge of tech stuff, even though I'm now just a \"spectator\". When I bought my last phone (4 years ago) and paid cash, I expected to get 4 years of service out of it. I'm pleased to say that I got 3 yrs and 10 months good service from it (FTR: it was an LG \"flagship\" at the time). When the radio in my old phone died, I thought long and hard about what to get. I read a lot about Huawei and how far they have come in the past 4 years with making inroads into the Western market, and it finally came down to the Honor 6x vs. the Mate 9. Due to my current financial limitations, I went ahead with the 6x. For now. I was not disappointed!! So, on the most immediate (perceived) drawback, I'll say that because I live in a semi-rural area, I am not (yet) a user of NFC. Very few merchants in my area even offer this. So, the lack of NFC is not a problem with me. With regard to the Wi-Fi speeds...my trusty Buffalo \"N\" series router is just fine (and will be used until it dies, just like its G-series predecessor). I can live without the 5GHz band. FTR DISCLAIMER: I'm not a gamer. All in all, I think that for about 1/2 the cost of a \"flagship\" phone, you get almost ALL of the important benefits. The 3 GB of RAM is more than enough to handle the apps that I use. Most important...the BATTERY LIFE is absolutely IMPRESSIVE. I can go all day, using the phone for moderate Internet and Facebook use, and still end up with more than 50% battery life. IN SUMMARY: The Honor 6x rocks circles around my old \"flagship\" LG phone from 2013. Yes, I know, 4 years is like an eternity in Tech, but when you are living on a very tight budget (and 99% of you will one day, I assure you), value IS a very important concern. The only \"drawback\" I've found thus far is the limitations of the EMUI 4.1 interface. I read many of the negative reviews of EMUI 4.1 on Marshmallow (Android 6.0), but the reason I went ahead and got this is because an update to Nougat with EMUI 5.0 is promised. I also signed up to be a Beta tester for EMUI 5.0 on Nougat (Android 7.1), so, if and/'or when I get the update, I will update this review. Nevertheless, for clarity, even with EMUI 4.1 on Marshmallow, I would not hesitate to recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for supreme VALUE for the dollar. Yes, it's true, that you \"get what you pay for\", but at $249, this phone is an EXCELLENT value for the dollar. Update: I'm not changing the Stars because this is a \"budget\" phone and for what you get for the dollar value, you still come out ahead. But for the benefit of Huawei (hopefully they are reading this), I do have a couple of suggestions. First, the Swipe Up shortcut menu from the lock screen is a GREAT idea. You have immediate access to Voice Recording, Calculator, Flashlight, and Camera. BUT...and this is a huge BUT...the stock calculator app is sorely lacking in features. To be honest, it is VERY sub-par. As far as I can find, there is no way to change it. I would suggest that either Huawei remake their stock Calculator App to have advanced functions, or else have a way to control which calculator app opens by default from the Home Screen Swipe Up shortcuts. A second issue I've found is less annoying (because there are other apps like SwiftKey Keyboard) but I will say that the stock EMUI 4.1 Huawei Swype Keyboard is pretty good...but I wish there could be a way to disable the \"Swype\" function of it. I like almost everything about the Huawei Swype Keyboard, BUT...the \"Swype\" key gets in the way of normal typing and there seems to be no way to disable it in the Settings. Therefore, I have installed SwiftKey, which seems more intuitive. However, if the Swype key could be disabled in the stock Huawei keyboard, I would not mind using the stock keyboard! Overall, I'm still highly satisfied with this phone, especially Battery Life, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to someone looking for an advanced SmartPhone at a \"Budget\" price.",

When i talked to the Amazon Tech rep they mentioned that they have known the issue here is the exact statement - \"Thank you very much. Yes, based on my resources performing reset should correct the issue. However we're getting the same problem. Now let me check for available options we have for you. \" **Edit - I talked to Both Amazon Support and the Huawei support and the only options were to get the phone replaced or repaired by Huawei. I opted for the replacement which will arrive early next week. I will test out the Google Maps via Car's Bluetooth and see if it works on the new phone and if it does not then i will return both phones and cut my losses on the Case and Screen protectors. Keeping my fingers crossed on this to work. I absolutely like the phone and I understand it's not as fast as the high end phones but I anticipated it at the price point. The only reason for the 3 stars is because I use my phone regularly via bluetooth and the Google maps instructions are abruptly ended for each instruction all throughout the way (for example \"After a mile turn slight right on I\" but it was supposed to be \"After a mile turn slight on I-35 to St.Paul\") and this becomes particularly difficult in a city and I go through with the voice instructions and not look at the phone. It does not happen if I don't connect to bluetooth. I am not able to find any solutions anywhere and it's bugging me as I am not able to get rid of it. I will call the customer support tomorrow and see if I find a solution. Also some of the incoming calls are going straight to voicemail without ringing and I get a VM notification if they left a message and that included the ones from Amazon Tech support before I wrote this review.",

                "review_text": "This is my first Huawei after my daughter has a positive experience with her 5X. My previous phone does not hold charge well; just using for a few minutes will take the power reserve down to 80% from full charge. I opted for 6X over 5X simply because it is a newer model. I actually don't like having to choose between SD card vs 2nd SIM card. This is the reason for taking one star off. In terms of performance, it is fast. Everything loads instantly. Signal reception is exceptionally well; it is by far the best of all cell phones I have ever owned. I was able to use the phone in a restaurant in my neighborhood that is a well known signal dessert. I don't play games and so cannot comment on game performance. Screen is pretty good but I have seen better ones. I don't have any issue with the stock interface. The camera was not the reason for me to buy this phone. But I found the camera to be quite good and useful. Bear in mind that I am dual camera system user with both a APS-c and m4/3 as well as 20+ lenses between the two systems. Photography is my main hobby. While I will not claim to be an expert, I think I am good enough to know the difference between good and bad. The dual lenses may be a gimmick, but I think it does provide a unique capability that can be useful. It is by no means an dslr replacement, but a good enough camera when I have nothing else. Battery has been excellent so far. It can go two days without having to charge over night and still have something left. I certainly hope that it stays like this for the long haul. It has been a terrific phone, especially at this price point. Highly recommended.",

I love the size, especially at a time when so many phones are going tall but narrow. Screen is bright and detailed, and it's ability to register touch is notably more accurate than my Samsung was. Battery life is incredible... I was able to go a full day of moderate to heavy use and have 30-40% left at bedtime. It's literally almost twice as good as that of my S7 Edge. I had no problems with slowdowns, and the phone easily kept up running Waze and streaming music at the same time. I'm not a gamer, so I can't comment specifically on that. Fingerprint reader is near instantaneous. Dual camera setup works very well - bokeh effect is well implemented and quite convincing. Low light is decent. Seriously, I would have gladly paid 350 bucks for this thing. Again, I had low expectations for this phone and it has blown me away. No, it's not a flagship phone at 1/5 the price, but it is more phone than most people really need. Get it!",

It started out fast, but as apps did self-updates, I added a few apps along the way, the speed is a bit slower, but the biggest hang up seems to be all the RAM used by apps. It was awesome at first, still great ... just can't even fully use Amazon shopping App without losing out to shortage of RAM. Same with most graphic intensive Apps. Don't regret it. Still like it ... I just wish there wasn't such a HUGE Price jump for a phone with more ram. (this has 3GB, instead of the 2GB of the Honor 5. Makes a difference ... But in the long run ... Someone needs to lower the running RAM cost on phones. (would be happening on any low end phone - but this one does have the extra 1GB ram, which makes a noticeable difference. Had Honor 5, which was a great phone value. But the 5 didn't have enough speed or ram for the number & levels of app updates to function w/out ram glitches HONOR 6X after 4 days, VERY PLEASED. Much, much faster than Honor 5, also: - Same size/appearance, BUT thinner & heavier (in a good way) like very high end phone - Screen excellent sharp and brightness. - MAYBE IT'S ME BUT THRILLED THE VOLUME AND POWER BUTTONS MOVED UP. Countless times with old Honor 5, I would carry the phone, and accidently push and hold power button causing a reboot. Not a problem, just annoying. Thus Honor 6X moving the buttons up, I can hold and carry the phone from the middle, the power button doesn't accidentally get pressed. Will update with use",

Battery life is simply amazing. I've never gone below 50% for a full day's use and it's typically 65% after 16 hours with my use. One day I didn't use the phone very much at all and it was around 90% by the end of the day. The display is crisp and a joy to view and read with excellent sharpness and brightness. It comes with a screen protector on it which I really appreciate. Sound is something that doesn't get much airplay today but I have to say it's positively the best sounding phone I've ever put my hands on. Have not experienced any call in which it was hard to hear. Everyone's voice comes in loud and clear and without any background noise. I'm getting a solid cell signal in my house whereas before it was marginal so I know it's pulling in a stronger signal. Picture quality is outstanding. I'm not a fan of low light pictures but the ones I've taken are at least ok. I don't think you could ask for better pictures in normal lighting. I love the Huawei implementation of the apps tray. It's really nice having the option of seeing all the apps appear in alphabetical order. This, while still having a conventional desktop in which you can place your favourite apps anywhere you want. The speed really shows with the 8 core processor. Web sites pop up real fast. The fingerprint scanner works instantaneously. Can't complain about the price at the $150 price it was available at on Amazon! This phone seems to fit better in my hands than any other phone I've picked up. Bluetooth came right up with my G-Cord headset and it's sounds better and clearer than on my previous phone. People I'm talking to say I sound just fine and they hear me perfectly well. I love the Do Not Disturb feature and it's ability to be scheduled so the phone can be setup so it will be guaranteed to be silent during sleeping hours. I am hard pressed to come up with any criticism of this phone. I realize it does not have near field communication (NFC) which means it can't be used for Android Pay or any of the other near field payment methods, however that's of no concern to me. I realize it has USB2 instead of USB3 but for me it only means my USB connectors with my other mobile devices such as a tablet are all still compatible so I can still use the same charging cables for all.",

My bluetooth now works so much better without any interruptions. After the phone is charged fully at night, it still shows 100% in the morning (the Note 4 would only show 95% charged in the morning). The finger print senor works like a charm on the 6X. It didn't work that well on the Note 4. Although the 6X is a much newer phone than the Note 4. I paid less than $220 for the 6x; I'm sure a Note 7 or something comparable would have cost me 2-3 times as much. It's true that the screen size is slightly smaller, and the picture quality is probably just a little less brilliant without OLED.

                "review_text": "I'm writing this review on my Honor 6x. Got it the day before Thanksgiving when it was $144. Ended up having Best Buy price match because I wanted it faster than the one I ordered from Amazon. Spent 6 years working for Apple but got bored and started using Android. Always liked stock Android (and hated bloatware), but EMUI isn't awful. The phone immediately updated when I turned it on to EMUI 5 (Android 7.0 Nougat). I was a little concerned when it didn't get any updates after the March update, but in November it got the October security update and then another a few weeks later to the December update. I'm assuming they're getting it ready for EMUI 8 (Android 8 Oreo). If they keep updating regularly, I'd be really impressed with Huawei and continue promoting them to everyone I know. So I'm usually picky about having stock software, but with the built in theme engine, you can make it look just like a pixel and download the pixel launcher and you're all set. It can even do the live wallpapers from the pixel 2. Also lets you uninstall most of the preloaded 3rd party apps and a lot of the Huawei ones can be uninstalled or disabled. Performance-wise, it's faster than my iPhone 6 I had. Almost as fast in everyday use as my iPhone SE. Of course it doesn't benchmark the same, but those don't show real world usage. The processor is on par with the Snapdragon 625 in most tests, like with the Moto G5 Plus. I rarely have slowdowns like I did when I tried the Honor 5x. I'm guessing the 3gb of memory is really what helps, especially on nougat. Camera is ok. If you have good lighting its pretty good. Dual camera tricks for bokeh effect is fun to play with, but sometimes it struggles to get a sharp enough focus on what you're wanting to not be blurry. Selfie camera is not very sharp, despite being 8mp. Doesn't seem much better than my iPhone SE 1.2mp. but in this pricerange, you're not expecting a great camera. Cellular is surprisingly good. Used it on both cricket/at&t and MetroPCS/T-Mobile. It has a better antenna than my iPhone, especially in buildings. Just wish it had WiFi calling. It does do VOLTE though. Audio was also better than my iPhone on calls, speaker phone isn't as loud as the 5x speaker, but not bad. Bluetooth works great, using 4.1 headphones as I write this. Have used these and other speakers quite a bit. Battery life... Wow! Did not expect this because most Android phones I've had I've just expected not to have as good of battery as iOS. I used to root other phones and put Greenify on them to help but on this it isn't needed. It manages background apps really well and you can tell it which apps to kill when the screen turns off. I regularly get 8.5 hours screen time with mixed usage. The phone manager app is actually really helpful and it has Avast built in for virus protection. It's also encrypted by default, if you're worried about security. Dual SIM is nice because my wife and I are moving to a country that only has two networks and it's expensive to call across them. You can use one slot to add to the storage if needed, but 32gb is plenty for me to have a bunch of games, apps, and still load a few movies on. Display is much nicer than the honor 5x was. I'd say it's on par with the iPhone 6 plus. Just don't expect AMOLED quality. Oh and get a glass screen protector because it isn't gorilla glass and has no oleophobic coating, so it looks like you licked it if you take off the factory screen protector. No fast charging, but again, most phones don't in this process range. No 5ghz WiFi... Just them cutting corners I guess. But it's a little ridiculous in 2017. But not a huge deal if you have decent wifi. Anyway, after working at a company that is mostly concerned with the user experience with it's products, it's nice to see another phone company care about that. Definitely will keep buying Huawei if this continues. The 7x is only $20 more than this phone at this point, so only get this if it's on a major sale.

                "review_text": "I've had the phone for a month now and I was struggling between giving 3 or 4 stars...and since I can't give it a 3.5 I'll give it 4 stars. So...I absolutely detest getting new phones. But because I was forced to when my LG3 started having all these annoying problems I decided to go with an unlocked phone that I could just pay outright for as opposed to being locked into a 2 year contract with my cellular provider. The reason I don't like getting new phones is because although I'm relatively savvy with technology, it takes some time to get used to the different features on new phones especially if you decide to go with a different manufacturer. So I'd never heard of Huawei and based on Amazon reviews and the reviews on PC Mag and other technology resources I decided to go with the Honor 6X. Over the past month I've had a few little minor issues with the phone like when I activate a certain feature it \"mysteriously\" deactivates itself. The camera feature not activating when I click on the icon or it taking a long time to load. I've even had to turn the phone off and back on a couple times to get the camera feature to load. This isn't good since I've only had the phone 30 days. The pics on the forward face feature in the camera (to take selfies) isn't all that clear which is a bummer. Especially when the camera feature is supposed to be one of the top features of the phone. I can't figure out how to turn up or down the sound feature only for notifications in various apps. It appears that whatever sound level you set for ringtone is the level across the board for texts and other app notifications which is a bit irritating. I wish that I could adjust the sound volume by going into the app settings. Then there's an issue with notifications on certain apps where I'm not notified at all when certain alarm times have been set. I also don't like that when you send a text message you can't tell which number of any contact is which (ie, cell, home, etc.) as it brings up all of the numbers you have associated with a particular contact, so I have to go out of the text look at the contact to make sure I'm not sending the text to the person's home or office no. So instead of starting a blank text it's best to go into contacts first then select the text icon from the number you want to text to...this is a bit annoying and can get more frustrating when you're texting to several people in one text. I also wish you could change the \"look\" of the text message so that the string looks like callout boxes as with Samsung and LG. It's just a pretty simple format but I guess that's really not a big deal at the end of the day. All said, for $250 the phone is a pretty decent. I could definitely compare it to some of the top tier phones I've had in the past. I love the fingerprint option...it works like a charm! It was basically a breeze (thanks to Google) to transfer all of my information inc my apps to the new phone in no time at all! I love that all of my apps are right there on the phone and I don't have to drill down to get to them (only wish they were in alphabetical order.) And did I mention the OUTSTANDING BATTERY LIFE! Honestly, this has to be the best part of owning this phone so far. I have NEVER run out of a charge. In the 30 days that I've had the phone I still normally have 65% at the end of the day. I only charge the phone at night before going to bed just to make sure it's fully charged for the next day but I really don't need to. And again I usually have 65-70% battery life remaining. For me this is a serious PLUS not having to charge the phone every 5 minutes. I am still learning new features on the phone almost daily which is a good thing. The phone is light and stylish. (Just wish there was a wider variety of phone covers available.) I just hope that some of the quirky, annoying issues that I've been having will just go away. ***8/1/17 UPDATE***Returned the phone and got a replacement. Unfortunately it is performing subpar as well. Having all of the same issues as I did before...and now the screen is freezing on the replacement. I believe they may have sent me a refurbished phone. I'm sending #2 back for a full refund. Not sure if I will be purchasing another as I believe I am getting refurbished phones instead of a brand new phone. Second did not have the new OS out of the box. Spent well over an hour downloading it. This isn't good at all.",

I received a message back stating that the battery swelling was my fault and they would not \"honor\" the warranty. Great phone if you only need it for a couple months.

I looked at both IPhone and several devices that ran on Android all v7. I was not aware some companies had different home screens than others and the set up is not standardized. This phone does not have the apps menu available as other android v.7 phones do. While this is not the end of the world it is very inconvenient and something I will think about every time I have to jump through 2-3 screens to get to the app menu. If there is a way to place the app menu on the home screen please let me know. Edit: You can change the style of your home screen. Go to Settings --> Home Screen Style --> and choose \"Drawer\" One of the main purposes I purchased this phone was the dual sim card capability and its ability to Incorporate an SD card. I was disappointed that you could not use two sim cards and an SD card at the same time. Now when I travel overseas I will have to forgo using my SD card, or remove my Sim Card that I use domestically....next time I will do further research before purchasing.",

Did not purchase for all the total crap the I-phones/Samsung note 8 and such have. We just wanted a phone mostly for a phone, some texting, taking pics and some net usage like most people our age. I did my homework on a number of Huawei phones and this one appealed to us. All reviews from different sites were great. This is a very nice looking phone, feels nice, good weight and the fingerprint reader is flawless and was easy to set up. Took to AT&T and was up and running with the app assistance they have. ALL contact info and photo's transferred, no problem, not like in the past with LG, Nokia, Moto and Samsung, a nightmare transferring stuff.

                "review_text": "So I'll start off and let you know how i got here and how I came to purchase this phone. I had a Note 7 on Verizon. After the first recall, got another Note 7. Held out with my second Note 7 until Verizon hotlined the Note 7 in late January rendering it essentially useless (redirecting outgoing calls to Verizon customer support). So with my phone useless, Verizon didn't help me at all, instead wanting me to upgrade and in the process lose my upgrade. So not wanting to waste my upgrade on a device from last year, I purchased this Honor 6X and switched to AT&T while I wait for the new Galaxy S8 to come out. When I first started using the phone, I couldn't believe how good it was for $250. Huawei is increasingly making more and more quality devices. I also have the more expensive mid-range Honor 8 which I got on sale for $280. What a great phone that is for the price I got it at. Display: While the screen is not 2K or AMOLED like my Note 7, it's still a very good 1080P panel. It seems to get pretty bright and the colors seem fine to me. Performance: Equipped with the HiSilicon Kirin 655 and 3GB of RAM, I haven't noticed really any slow downs or stutters with this device. In all honesty, it seems just as fast and smooth as my Note 7, believe it or not. It seems like Huawei included a pretty potent processing package for this device. Software: Took me a little while to get used to it coming from TouchWiz. It has a different style but is still functional. It ships with EMUI 4 which is based on Android 6.0. I was kind of disappointed it didn't ship with EMUI 5.0 on Android 7 but the update is coming (hopefully soon). Gaming: I don't really do any gaming on mobile so I can't really speak to it's performance in this area. Camera: The camera seems to take pretty good pictures. Of course it's no comparison to the sensor on the Galaxy S7s or Note 7. The only thing I really don't like is the time it takes to get the camera to focus to take the picture so I don't always get the picture I'm wanting at the time. When you take a picture the phone says \"Hold device steady to sharpen\". Battery: The battery life on this phone has been amazing. The Honor 6X packs a 3340mAh battery. Only having to push a 1080P panel instead of 2K really contributes to this devices longevity. I do a lot of texting and listening to music and can go all day and not get past 80%. Other: I don't really don't like how it's equipped with the increasingly outdated micro USB. I would have preferred a Type C but really shouldn't complain at this price point. Conclusion: I think this is a great budget device. $250 is still a decent amount of money to pay for a phone, but I think this would be a great back up phone granted you use a GSM carrier. I plan on using it until the Galaxy S8s come out and will keep the Honor 6X as a back up.",

Due to the melting, it is now unable to charge to any functional level. We contacted Huawei customer service for help under the warranty. They were friendly but repeatedly unhelpful. They require you to ship back the phone so they can check on whether it can be repaired first (outdated policy, but fine); however, the process takes weeks and they do not provide a loaner phone in the meanwhile. In a modern society where the average consumer relies heavily on a smartphone for personal and business use, it would be far more reasonable to at least offer a replacement and then if the faulty product can be repaired, sell it as refurbished OR provide a loaner phone during the inspection/repair/shipping time frame. There also seems to be no option from Huawei directly to just receive a refund so you can purchase a replacement yourself.",

This also has FM radio receiver with ear phone inserted working as antenna. What a brilliant idea to have radio in cell phone (no internet radio, real FM radio !). I was not decisive whether I need to choose higher CPU and memory performance similar price but form different brand. But as I watched youtube benchmark test comparing speed with galaxy note 8, I made up my mind to buy this one - this is slightly faster than galaxy note 8. Battery life is very good. Impressive battery life(not replaceable battery probably).

After seeing some of the newer phones come out in the past few months I'm so glad I picked up this phone at the beginning of the year. With all of these $800-$1000 price points I don't know how people can justify buying something that expensive when the specs & speed of the Honor 6x is just as good. The fingerprint scanner is amazing and after going from a phone that didn't have a fingerprint scanner I'm very glad that I made the move to this. There have been a few videos on Youtube showing the durability of the Honor 6x and it isn't the best but if you buy a case and keep the cheap screen protector that it came with you won't have any issues with a cracked screen or anything. I've dropped mine without a case and I did get some scuffs on the corners of the phone, but nothing happened to the actual screen. I would recommend getting a case as soon as you buy it, there are a few on Amazon that are really good and are like $10. The battery life is SO good on the phone too. I typically can go an entire day on just 40% battery and I can usually charge up to that point within the 30 minutes or so that it takes me to drive to school. Then when I come home I still have about 10% left. There is an ultra battery saver too that will let your phone last for like 4 or 5 days or more if you just left it on the whole time. All in all, it is a great phone and I can't see how people can justify spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on other new phones when there are ones like this or the newer Huawei phones that are over $500 cheaper. I haven't had any issues with the phone... For a while, I changed a few settings so that I would get more of my app notifications (which sometimes don't do a good job at notifying you when you get a new notification?) and I noticed that it slowed down the phone a bit. But as long as you choose which apps are most important and just let those apps constantly run you won't have any issues with slowdowns or anything. OH but one negative that I have with this phone... My Fitbit Charge 2 doesn't work with it as consistently as I would like. Some days it will sync really well and I'll receive my messages and calendar updates but other days it is really spotty and I might get one or two messages that show up on my fitbit. I have contacted Fitbit about this issue but they say that it is something wrong with Huawei's chipset or something and they are trying to get it figured out but have been having some issues.",

I did as instructed and was able to pair most of the devices in my home, except the Fitbit device and Bose speakers, which I assume do not support my phone.

The Honor 6x I purchased was GSM, unlocked, and I use it with Cricket. I just popped the SIM card from the iPhone into the Honor 6x and it worked - didn't even have to go into the Cricket store! Have been using the phone two weeks and really put it through its paces and it has performed flawlessly and I really like it a lot and don't miss my iPhone at all. Won't get into all the details, but will say that the phone is loaded with great features, and I really like the hotspot feature, which provides me a wifi signal to my chromebook just about anywhere I go! The cam is excellent. Phone has enough battery juice to use the phone all day no sweat. And the dual SIM set up enables one the have two phone numbers associated with this one phone, which could come in handy for business use or international travel. Was worried that it wouldn't be so easy to access all seven of my email accounts on the Honor 6x vs. the iPhone, but it is actually better! I have never used the latest greatest iPhone 8 or whatever, but I can't imagine it is worth paying many $100s more?! UPDATE: Have had the phone for 3 months now. Still love it. For $150 it is a no-brainer. Only issue I've had is that sometimes the phone doesn't seem to want to transition from wifi signal to wireless. It eventually transitions, but is not seamless. Have tried lots of different settings, don't think the issue is on my end. Maybe it has to do with the strength of signal from Cricket? But not really a big deal. Also, the case Spigen makes for this phone is just great. The nice thing is, if i drop this phone or wreck it, for just $150 I've go a brand new, great replacement! I won't be going back to Apple iPhone....",

                "review_text": "This is my initial early review. Moving from a huge 6'' cheap ZTE Zmax Pro to this Honor 6x This is a solid little phone. It comes with Android 7 or else immediately upgrades to that (it took about 45 minutes of initial loading and setup). It is loaded with Huawei's UI and not stock android, but it doesn't really have bloat ware or a ton of special suites. Even so I installed the Microsoft Launcher which in my experience is the cleanest, most practical launcher that organizes things much better than the standard UI. With 3 GB of RAM it runs fairly quickly, downloaded and installed about 70 apps in only a few minutes. Even running some heavier games like SimCity it handles with relative ease. The camera is nice, the dual lens means you can take portrait pictures while putting the background out of focus. The screen is brighter than most phones I've had but the auto-adjustment is a little sensitive and can quickly go bright or dark. Here are my initial Pros and Cons: Cons: - The screen times out in about 8 seconds and I have adjusted every single setting to make this 30 seconds to a minute but it still isn't right. I reset all the settings and that helped a little, now it will go maybe 15 seconds, but certainly doesn't stay lit the 30 seconds or minute that I have it set to. This makes reading very annoying as it will just go black and then lock. And since you can't just tap the screen to wake up or swipe back into it (another con I mention below) it takes extra time with the lock screen or fingerprint sensor. - There is one speaker located at the bottom right of the phone. This makes holding the phone in landscape mode while watching a video mostly mute the sound. It should be located on the front or the back. Even holding the phone upright I found my hand or finger often covered the speaker. - In order to use the fingerprint sensor on the back you have to lock the phone with either a pin or password. If you restart the phone you can't get right into it without entering the pin. And if you use another launcher, (like I do) their security setting (like a pattern) doesn't matter because it still takes you to the phone's pin screen. (so there's always two lock screens) - You can't tap or double tap on the screen to view the lock screen, (something that is standard in new versions of android) and you can't swipe in simply without entering your pin - No NFC - No Dual-band Wifi (like 5Ghz) - The \"dual\" sim slots is a combo port for SD card / sim card. So you can have 1 Sim and 1 SD Card - No physical navigation buttons, just a designated navigation bar at the bottom of the display that fades and disappears with full screen apps. This unfortunately eats up screen real estate, makes it a tad slower to actually navigate and takes away easier navigation by touch. - the front facing camera seems too saturated with it's colors, everything is very high contrast - Doesn't have the newer C-type USB - Since it isn't stock Android you can't allow apps to take over certain things. For example I use textra (a texting app) and on my last two phones I could use the notifications and pop up menu of textra, with the look and feel that is customizable in textra for incoming texts. But this still uses the phone's build in notification settings. Pros: - Decent Camera - Quick finger-print reader - Processor and Ram combo are very good for this price point, very happy with how fast apps load - 32 GB of storage, this is mostly standard these days but there are still budget phones that come with 8 or 16 - Bright Screen, easily readable in sunlight or bright areas - Pretty quick charge for a micro-USB - Seems to have all the T-Mobile bands - Battery - everyone said the battery was great and lasts a day and half or 2 days, but I found with maybe an hour of gaming and then general use, news, twitter, some texting and such it still needed a charge by the afternoon. Maybe I'm a heavy user. - General look and feel Overall even though I found a number of things I didn't like or aren't included (NFC, Dual band etc) this is a good phone for the price. It will handle just about any apps or games you want, and with 32GB of storage you will have plenty of room. It takes good pictures and videos. The antenna is ok, I've had better reception on other phones but it's fine. It's a good looking phone and seems well built. The user interface was ok, but I didn't like it that much, as I said I installed Microsoft Launcher which is wonderful.",

                "review_text": "This is the second phone I've purchased by Huawei. The first one was a honor 5x, which worked brilliantly, but was not pool-resistant. Shortly after I purchased the honor 6x, which seemed to work similarly and occasionally better, the shape was slimmer (I will miss the attractive brick qualities of the 5x). Where the 6x really stood out was the camera. I had not realized how nice it was until I went on a trip to Tahoe and started playing around with it(photo below). In fact my brother and I were so impressed with the phone, he ended up getting a 6x as well. The one negative I will say is the Bluetooth can be moody at times.",

I have found it to be super glitchy and getting more so the longer I have it- screen unresponsive, going black, freezing, etc. The worst has been the camera. Everytime I open that app, the screen either stays black, or whatever I have the camera pointed at is frozen on the screen. As a parent and a teacher of young children, I need a camera that can turn on and take a picture as fast as my kids move! And last night, I almost missed being able to record my son's band competition- the screen kept freezing, I had to restart the phone several times, the screen would \"grey out\", home button wouldn't work, and power button wouldn't work. The only reason I was able to record the performance was because a technical difficult caused a delay in their start time. But it was literally at least 5 minutes before I could get the camera to function correctly. If you need to be able to take pictures or videos quickly, this might not be the best choice.. :(",

It is a replacement for my Huawei P8 Lite which i used for 3 years and was impressed by the quality of phone for the price range. I don't mind the EMUI that Huawei adds on. I think it has a rather handy set of tools out of the box. Photos are much better than my previous P8 and also enjoy using the fingerprint sensor. Very easy to use. One touch and it unlocks. I have wondered if this was just a gimmick. But i asked others to try unlocking the phone by touching and they could not. So definitely quite a secure method of accessing. If you are the kind that does not want to pay for a phone with an arm and a leg, this is a phone for you. It is unlocked so will work internationally and locally with carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile. Update: Jan 2018. I still love it. Some have asked Android version. The one I have is 7.0 Nougat.",

                "review_text": "After dealing with unreliable phone service providers (I'm looking at you, Virgin Mobile and Straight Talk) and glitchy phones (I'm looking at you LG Volt and Volt 2 as well a a Samsung Galaxy phone) that consistently contained way too much bloatware (because of said unreliable phone services) and eventually started to die faster and faster, I decided to do a lot of research for a few months before deciding which phone brand and service provider I would switch to. I was initially looking at the Honor 8, but the price was a bit steep for me, so I decided to wait. I'm a firm believer in that you don't need to spend $400+ on a good phone and that the best phone service doesn't have to cost you hundreds of dollars a month. After taking a small break from research, I came back to Amazon and found this phone last week. The price was nice, and while the reviews were mixed, I decided to take a plunge and buy this phone after watching a few videos about it and reading articles about it. I also ditched Virgin Mobile in favor of Cricket (which has been amazing so far! I actually get reception at home, in the middle of my rural/ghost town). The phone arrived two days after I ordered it and the battery was at 60% battery out of the box, giving me the ability to activate it right away and play around with it. A lot of these reviews complain about the operating system skin/EMUI (along with various other things), but honestly, it's not all that different to me. Maybe it's because I adapt really quickly to things and have a fast learning curve (and am pretty tech savvy for not knowing all the correct terminology). Before I list positives and negatives, let me just say that the most important things to me in a phone are internal storage space, processing power, and battery life. Oh, and of course, customization capabilities (like changing font faces), GPS, and a nice set of front and back facing cameras. I don't care so much about having to learn or adapt to a new style of system, since I enjoy learning about them and getting used to them on my own. POSITIVE POINTS 1. Internal Storage: which allowed me to uninstall the useless apps that were pre-installed. The capacity also allowed me install all the apps that I previously had spread out between different devices (because each one had bloatware that couldn't be uninstalled or disabled). It also gave me the ability to add new games/apps that I've been wanting to try. Even after installing all the apps I wanted to, as well as migrating data from apps I previously used (including: Discord, Kingdom Hearts Unchained X, Sword Art Online: Memory Defrag, Mystic Messenger, Sailor Moon Drops, Alphabear. Pokemon GO [which I can actually use AR mode, finally], TsumTsum, Steven Universe: Soundtrack Attack, Tumblr, Instagram, Snapchat, LINE, LINE Camera, Layout, Bitmoji, LINE Webtoon, Zedge, and Huawei Themes), I still have more than half of my internal storage space free. 2. Battery Life/Processing Power: if you read through my long list of apps above, then you can guess I enjoy a fair amount of mobile gaming and a little bit of social media in my spare time. This phone doesn't slow down and doesn't overheat while I play for hours when I get the chance for it. The battery of course, drains, but not anywhere near as quickly as my old phones/devices did. After a full charge, I was able to enjoy 8-10+ hours of gaming and switching from app to app without having to worry about recharging. When the phone isn't in use, the battery life is even more impressive, barely draining from hour to hour. I went from having to charge my previous devices multiple times a day or having them die out on me, to only needing to charge once a day, usually at night/when I go to bed. I also love not having to deal with crashing apps/glitchy apps. 3. Cameras: perhaps because my previous experiences with phone cameras have been full of disappointments, I can easily say that the cameras on this phone are 100% fantastic. Even though I don't take a lot of selfies, I do take lots of pictures of things aside from myself (like nature, food, arts/crafts, scenery, etc.), and the images come out crystal clear and pretty vibrant, unless it's in a low-light setting. Of course, I rarely would even think of taking a photo in that environment, so that doesn't bother me or dull my enthusiasm for this phone. I look forward to being able to play around with my cameras more. 4. Fingerprint Scanner: I just think this is a really cool feature, now no one but me can unlock my phone, which is pretty awesome. I have had no problems with it and setting it up was really simple and quick. 5. GPS/Compass: Since playing Pokemon Go, this became something of great importance to me. My previous devices were absolutely terrible when it came to playing this game. However, this phone has given me the smoothest experience with absolutely no GPS-related problems. 6. Graphics: To be concise, the graphics/display quality on this phone is easily a 10/10 for me. Youtube videos and all my game/apps look sharp and clear. The colors aren't dull or overly vibrant. NEUTRAL POINTS 1. Customization: If you, like me, enjoy changing fonts, then you'll need to install an app, like Huawei Themes, which provides a nice selection of font faces to use. It's a bit of a shame that there aren't options other than the default font pre-installed, but this doesn't bother now that I have an app for that. 2. Speaker: I usually use my headphones, but on the random occasion that I decide not to, I will admit, the speakers tend to be on the quieter side until you turn the volume up 70% or more. It's not that big a deal, but I thought to just put that out there for honesty's and informing others' sake. 3. I am used to having the option to move an app's data from the internal storage to an SDcard. This phone, as far as I've explored, doesn't provide the option to do so. This doesn't bother me because I have plenty of internal storage for apps and plenty of external storage for everything else, so this is just something I thought to note. NEGATIVE POINT 1. Not enough case options, though this doesn't reflect so much on the phone's manufacturer as it does on those who manufacture phone cases. I just really want to be able to buy a clear plastic case for this phone (for decoden) and character cases (like Rilakkuma , Gudetama, or Stitch or just in general, cute cases), but I can't because there aren't any. I had to settle for a basic, dual layer case (the case provides really nice protection though). Just in case any of you need a case, here's the link: Honor 6X Case with Built-in Stand, SPARIN Rugged Dual Layer Cases for Huawei Honor 6X 2017 with [360 Degree Ring Stand] [Corner Protection ].",

                "review_text": "Was hesitant to get this considering how cheap it was since with most electronics you get what you pay for. Caught a case of the fumbles and dropped my Galaxy S7e and cracked the screen. Didn't have insurance on it since I've never broken a phone before so needed a temp phone to hold me over until new models come out early/mid next year. WOW have I been surprised! The fingerprint sensor works better than my S7 and this 6X seems to run just as if not faster for what I use it for. Calls are clear on both ends and it works great on AT&T 4G. Not a big photo person but the camera does take great pics when I do use it not to mention lots of editing options. For an \"economy\" phone I was not expecting much from the speaker but again was amazed; sound is great too. It's not HTC boom sound but hey no phone is but HTC. The battery? The battery is unbelievable. Another huge surprise. Was in the habit of putting my phones on charge overnight, and sometimes during the day, but actually have not had to every night with the 6X. It's like the energizer bunny and just keeps going and going and going. Have been so impressed with this phone that as it stands I will continue using it and forego spending money on another major name flagship phone for now. The 6X for under $200 (cost me barely over $100 after Amazon rewards points) or between $650 - $1000 for another big name flagship that in reality would not be any better in a substantial way? hmmm that's a tough one ;)",

The screen is bright and legible in sunlight with the auto ambient light feature generally working well. The fingerprint sensor works very well. Sound quality is very good. The phone easily lasts more than a day, seems more like two. Build quality is very nice. My only real issue is the built-in email program. You have the option of seeing the mail from one account at a time or all of them at once. I keep choosing the latter, but the program keeps defaulting to the former. I could use the Gmail program which would solve this, but i don't want Google reading through my mail. There is a very helpful guy online [webcazine] who answers questions about the honor 8 which generally apply to the honor 6 as well and he says that the email program is supposed to remember the last choice and keep it. So this appears to be a software bug. And i have not been able to \"cast\" the phone screen to my TV even though I have a ROKU which is supposed to be miracast compatible and this phone is supposed to have miracast from what i can tell. And there does not appear to be a full product guide for the honor 6, although they have guides for the honor 8. These last 3 reasons are responsible for only giving 4 stars instead of 5. I will say that the online and phone support is open 7 days a week with almost no hold time and they try to solve your problems. In general I am impressed that this phone is a great value. If it was waterproof it would be perfect. ** After 5 months This phone is not a good as I thought and I am removing a star. Two problems have arisen. First, my Garmin stopped connecting to my phone about 2 months ago. Garmin seems to have done their due diligence by keeping me informed about the problem after I contacted them and the sending me an email telling me that the problem had been solve, working with Huawei engineers (the problem was not just with the Honor 6 but all Huawei phones), but that the fix would need to come from the Huawei side. Perhaps it was just passing the blame, but calls to Huawei were not informative. They were answered but the Huawei spokespeople (who are easy to reach but less informed that I would like) would neither confirm nor deny that they knew about the problem. They told me that an upgrade would fix the problem, without saying when an upgrade would occur, and since they didn't indicate that they even knew about the problem I do not believe that they could have known that an upgrade to fix it was coming. This was very disappointing. One of my reasons in getting the phone was to have more compatibility than my prior Windows phone, and using the phone with the Garmin vivoactive was an important consideration because the windows phone had only mixed compatibility with the Garmin. Right now, there is zero compatibility between the phone and the watch. The second problem is that the fingerprint reader stopped working. After cleaning it off and reinstalling my fingerprint, it is working again, but I wonder if I will need to repeat this every 3 or 4 months.",

                "review_text": "I've been using this phone for a couple of weeks now, and I am very happy with my purchase. It was a bit of an adjustment as I was transitioning from a far more \"budget\" phone, so this one blew me out of the water. Everything runs super fast, and I haven't run into any incompatibility issues. After updating the OS to the latest version, I was able to use every other launcher I've tried (settled on one that emulates a Win 10 OS). By far, my favorite feature is the fingerprint scanner on the back; it immediately wakes my phone up with even a very quick tap of my finger, bypassing the lock screen so I can get back to what I was doing without delay. The cameras are pretty good, and the default camera app comes with all sorts of auto-editing software to up your selfie game, if that's what you're into. The back cameras take very good pictures, with the additional camera being good for adding a bit of depth, if nothing else. One of the features that is just a nice addition is the Eye Comfort mode, that when turned on reduces the blue light emitted by the screen, which helps a lot if you like to use your phone before bed (like myself). Bluetooth and wifi and all that stuff works fine, as you would expect, and I was set up pretty much immediately after inserting my T-mobile Sim card. Not much else to say, it does what it says and runs everything I've tried rather well. Will update if I start having problems with it",

Unfortunately, after owning it for 6 months, and always keeping it in its case with a glass screen protector, I noticed that the phone was substantially bent. My wife had just purchased one of these a few weeks before I noticed the bend. I looked at hers and it was also bent. This lead me to look into the different stress tests that have been done on the 6x. It turns out, the 6x has failed bend tests across the board. I contacted Huawei and they agreed to replace my phone. However, when I asked them about options for upgrading, since the new phone would inevitably bend, the customer service manager suggested \"you could just sell this phone to one of your friends and buy a different one.\" Huawei has the potential to really compete with the bigger phone companies, but they need to take responsibility for flawed design and recall/replace their defective product with something that will last more than a few months.",

Faster phone 2. Good Camera 3. Decent Battery 4. Large screen 5. Speedy internet and also WiFi 6. Decent Brand. 7. Memory Slot How do I use - We are not gamers but heavily access internet, GPS, social sites and music. I researched all the small and medium brands and phones under $200 and shortlisted with 3 options - LeEco, Huawei and ZTE. With almost the same hardware combination, I decided to read reviews about HH 6X. Its way better than 5X and reviews in amazon, google were compelling. 1. Phone is faster than the 5X and similar to LeEco and ZTE brands. I researched them in walmart and stores nearby. 2. Camera is decent, poor light is a problem, but ok for a limited use. 3. Battery is ok, per my use, a full day is good so that I can charge by the night. But charging is as usual rate, wish they had the dash faster charging. 4. Screen and speed of apps acceptable over WiFi. I like wider screens so that you can view a little larger font, without much eye strain.. 5. Huawei is a decent brand, I see lots of phone these days, 6. I wanted memory slot to hold more photos and music. Now I have an unlimited supply, 64 GB card slot. 7. I wanted Wifi Calling, but TMobile doesnt provide it for now. Why 4 stars ? 1. At almost the same price, ZTE provides better audio and a bit better hardware. 2. 12 MP camera, Zooming in some of the pics were not so good, ZTE offered 16 MP. 3. Battery non removable. Definitely 5 stars if the same phone was sold about $40-$50 less.",

I did a lot of research on the Honor 6X before I decided to buy it. There's a lot I like about the phone so I am gonna break it down for everyone real quick: It's 5.5 inches tall, The only iPhone bigger than that is the X. Comes with 64 GB of memory and can be expanded by another 200+ GB by putting an SD card in the second SD card slot. Yes, that's right, There's a second SD card slot and you can expand the memory. Can't do that on an iPhone either. The battery is fantastic and can last an easy 24 hours before you have to charge it. I say that honestly because I put this phone through the ringer - Playing games, Videos, Music, Taking photos and all that jazz. The battery was still strong and just laughably puts the iPhone to shame because, on a good day, It's gonna last 8-10 hours top. The operating system runs smoothly, I have no issues with it. I love that I can search google from the home screen without having to open the web browser. Everything is readily available from the jump so I don't have to go through a hassle of using it. It fits fine in my hand, Doesn't feel heavy or bulky at all. That was a concern for me because it's a lot larger than my old iPhone but after a few minutes, You don't even notice it. Honestly, I don't know why more people haven't tried this phone out. It's bigger, more (and expandable) memory, The battery runs longer and it works phenomenally. Yeah, I get that I may be coming off as a paid reviewer but I am not. I genuinely like this phone and I won't be going back to Apple.",

First of all it looks good, and comes with a nice screen protector that has already saved me a lot of scratches. I've dropped it a couple of times on concrete, and I got some bumps on the corners but screen came out fine with no cracks. Camera is great with excellent daylight pictures and decent low-light results. It can take a while to startup and focus, so not really good for the spur of the moment instant shot. Call quality and controls are decent. My negatives start with the finish of the back cover. The rough metallic finish is very smooth in the palm, particularly when my palm is dry. This means the phone easily slips from my hand unless I grip it firmly. It can be annoying when you're just trying to pick up the phone. The software is not that great; especially the phone book and calendar. The phone book has no easy way to save contacts to Google by default, so in the end I had to turn off the phone contacts completely so it can only save to Google. It also has a \"merge\" feature that seems to force all the merged contacts to the phone. Well, one fine day I woke up to find all my contacts GONE. I had to restore from Google, but all the merged records could not be recovered. FInally, I discovered that 32GB is nowhere near enough. Now I'm getting these annoying reminders to free space whenever I try to do something. I have to delete files to make the reminders go away. Overall a nice phone and good value for the price. The flaws I observed can be fixed without changing the cost.",

I bought this when my last phone breathed it's last breath a couple of weeks ago. It's a pretty phone, but I've had problems with it from day one. First, the fingerprint sensor only recognizes my print less than half the time I use it. I end up locking myself out because no matter what I do, the sensor thinks I'm not me! Second, the phone started freezing up within a couple days of receiving it. The screen will go dark and no buttons will work, not even the power button. I've restarted the phone a bunch of times over the last two weeks and it only fixes the problem temporarily. Third, when it's not frozen, it lags SO MUCH. I'll press a button and literally nothing happens for at least 10 seconds or more. Again, restarting the phone stops this temporarily. It does take gorgeous pictures in basically any light, which is a drastic change from my last phone's garbage pictures! The audio is pretty good too, which is nice! There are so many cool things this phone can do and I really want everything to work properly! I'm going to check out the manufacturer customer service now to see what can be done.",

The screen is very vibrant and responsive to touch. The fingerprint sensor on the back will almost instantaneously unlock and turn on the phone. On average, I get anywhere from 4 to 5 days out of the battery, but I am not a heavy phone user and your experience will probably be different. I have recently begun using it with a smartwatch and because of that, I do have to leave the Bluetooth switched on and that has been reducing my battery life to around 3-4 days. I also make it a habit of keeping all of the features of the phone (or any phone that I own) switched off such as the wi-fi, GPS, etc. in order to prolong the battery life. The phone also has two different battery saver modes that will extend that life even further if you wish to engage them. The camera is more than adequate for my needs and I have no complaints. I am currently using the phone with Cricket Wireless and have experienced absolutely no problems with it. Phone has full Android functionality and is kept updated. If I had to be picky just to find something wrong with the phone, it would be speaker as I do not think it's that great. However, I rarely need to use it, so it's a non issue. Overall, if you want an outstanding phone that will not break the bank and will not keep you tied to a specific cell phone provider, give this phone a try. Why spend $800 to $1000 for Apple or Samsung when you can have one of these?",

After owning nothing but black phones I opted for white and gold, and it doesn't disappoint. The gold adds a touch of style and class. It is almost like a light champagne gold. The display is a little bigger than the G5 plus and offers awesome colors. There are thin black bezels around the display on the white variant but they are also found on most other phones as well, even iPhone. They definitely aren't that thick like they were on the Honor 5X though. You can set color temperatures (custom, cool, warm) and even turn on a blue light filter for bedtime viewing, which is a major plus! Also, the camera is an absolute steal given the price point of the phone! The aperture effect is awesome thanks to the dual camera set up, it shoots clear and detailed pictures (photo sample provided), it has a lot of nice editing features like filters, picture tools, etc.! It doesn't have 4k video but I don't mind that since I don't shoot much video on my phone. But having the slomo video option is a plus! Although this phone does not have an ambient display like Moto phones, it has a nice LED notification light (color can be customized)! I also like the new update to EMUI 5.0, Android nougat 7.0 update. The UI is iPhone esque but it is nice! I have had zero issues with performance or lag at all as of now. I was a little worried after watching a durability test with the honor 6x on YouTube but as long as you have a screen protector and a case, and don't try to bend the phone on purpose, you will be fine! After being loyal to Motorola, I must say I think Huawei has won over a new customer! Overall, I can easily recommend this phone especially if you're on a budget!

The cameras are just great. Rear camera takes amazing pictures in daylight and with the flash. Low-light pictures are better than most phones well into the $300 price range. Front camera is good enough. The phone is very quick. I've not experienced any lag in any app and the phone will reboot in under 10 seconds. Battery life exceeded my expectations. You can really trust that \"1.5 days of heavy use\" claim they make. Speakers are loud and good quality. In-call volume and clarity is great... But don't expect your music to sound wonderful at max volume. But... There's a headphone jack! Also, EMUI 5 is not a bad interface by any means. Cons: No fast-charge... Charging takes quite a few hours. So many built-in apps. Some that can't be uninstalled without root... Another option would be to hide them with a third-party launcher like Nova (prime) It's difficult to make photos save to the SD card. Switching the default storage location to the SD card in Settings seems to cause some apps to glitch out, so it may be best to use a third-party camera app that has the option to chose the storage location. The preinstalled screen protector was placed on slightly sideways. Doesn't seem to be wide enough to actually cover the entire screen, regardless. I would recommend replacing it.",

The LG-G4 was insured (for an extra $10 / month in my contract) so it was replaced with a refurbished model of the same. Guess what! A couple of months down the road the refurbished LG-G4 died on me again!!! the LG company played dumb. I had no idea that this phone was out there, I didn't even know what an \"unlocked phone\" until a trusted friend talked to me about the Honor 6X and highly recommended it. Solely upon my trusted friend's recommendations when time came to choose another phone from my carrier or buy mine, I chose the later option and bought my H. 6X. Let me tell you: This was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I use it almost 5 months now with no issues whatsoever. The battery is excellent, lasts me almost twice as much than my previous high end / more expensive LG model for same / compatible type of usage. Downloads and updates seem to happen in half speed, blue tooth radius extends twice as far, as well as wi-fi receptivity. Just to offer you an example: with my previous more expensive LG-G4 phone when I went one room away - in any direction - from the location where my wi-fi router is located the signal was dropped / lost. With my Honor 6X I connect to my wi-fi in my car, in my driveway (!) which was an impossibility with my previous supposingly better brand name phone! The camera of the Honor 6X on paper is of a lesser quality that the camera of my ex- LG phone, yet I haven't really noticed any difference in the quality / clarity / resolution of the pictures the 6X takes. Most excellent pictures! Bottom Line: I'd buy this phone or from this company (Huawei) again if need be with closed eyes, without a second thought!",

                "review_text": "At the price of $150 a week before Christmas, the 6X is a great buy versus rivals like the Moto G5 or G5s , and lesser known phones like Alcatel 4s or ZTE Axion. Other options might be refurbished older Samsungs or Apples. I actually have an Alcatel Idol 3 that has been a very good phone for the last 2 years - Amazing Audio - and I recently was given a rather worn looking used Note 3, which I do like.. I even looked at Samsung 8 and Apple 8 when T-Mobile had them 2-for-1... My son spends smartphone money like water (Sonys mostly) and my daughter is nothing but Apple ( 7s now, looking at the 8 or X). Those just don't offer anything but name prestige for my purposes, since I don't game on a smartphone's tiny screen, and I have laptops and tablets for serious streaming video. I started checking out options under $250 about Dec 1st... I eliminated the Idol 4 even tho I loved the Idol 3, since the 4 is till at $250 vs the 6X, and I knew I would take a 6X given those prices. The Idol 4 comes with VR that doesn't interest me, and the VR is getting poor reviews. Tried the Moto G5S at $249, but its design, weight, and camera were bettered by the 6X. The Moto screen may barely edge out the 6X. A refurb Apple 6 or Samsung S5 did not interest me, but may be an option you could choose. Pro: The Honor 6X has a nice modern design and feel. Battery life is very good for casual streaming. Reception on 4G LTE is at least equal to the Note 4, using T-Mobile. It is either dual sim ( 4G LTE + 2G second sim) or single (4G LTE plus SD memory card). It gets all the T-Mobile bands as far as I can tell, because inside-building reception is pretty good, compared to the Alcatel. The camera is very good, certainly above the Idol 3 and even a notch above the Note 4. Con: I've been spoiled by my Idol 3's JBL audio...nothing even today comes close. And the Idol has a very nice black rendition and good color. But the Idol's reception seems weaker now. The 6X has only decent sound, a bit tinny compared to the Moto G5s. I would rate both of them about a notch below my wife's Moto X Pure, Display quality is good, not brilliant, and slightly \"cool blue\", as opposed to \"warm orange\". Blacks seem not black enough for me tho. Still, at that $150 (a price low enough I went for the 2-yr Sq Trade warranty also), I feel this was a good deal. Balances looks, reception on all bands, decent video streaming, battery life....those are some important things I look for.",

The battery life is amazing, the fingerprint scanner is instant, doesn't have issues with freezing, overall just a really great phone! ---------------- I desperately needed a new phone but didn't have a lot to spend, so I spent a few weeks researching which one to get and ended up going with this one. I'm glad I did! It's considered a \"budget\" phone, but it definitely doesn't seem like one. Doesn't feel cheap, runs smooth, and it's big, but not too big. It came exactly as described, and even had a screen protector already on it, although it was only big enough to cover the screen itself and not the whole front of the phone. That bothered me so I took it off. Completely satisfied with this phone, and am in the process of convincing my fiance to buy the same one haha",

My G4 Plus was snappier in about everything compared to the Honor 5X. I was pleasantly surprised that the Honor 6X is actually faster in opening many apps compared to the Moto G4 Plus. I like the shape and form and rounded screen. The camera takes great pictures so far. There is only one thing that bugs me: there is either very poor application of or no oleophobic coating on the screen. It attracts finger prints and moving the finger does not feel smooth at all. I tried two different tempered glass screen protectors but neither of them stay adhered on the visible area of the screen (they lift off 0.5cm all around). I should have left the plastic screen protector on the phone when I got it of course. I just purchased a new set of screen protector (made by Dmax Armor) and it is much better than the actual screen with respect to smudges and finger prints and feel. I'd give this a 4.5 but that's not an option. Great phone, but why do a shortcut on something the consumer has to feel constantly using the phone I don't understand. I'm glad I did a Google search to find a few reports on this shortcoming - otherwise I'd have asked for a replacement.",

                "review_text": "Pros: solid, decent screen (not great), fast operation, good OS, pretty good camera. Cons: speaker is weak, decent screen but washed out, battery is pretty good but if you use the phone with apps or music as you need to charge at least once per day. As just a communication device, that battery will last 2-3 days easy. I listen to a lot of audiobooks and music on the speakers and stream shows as well as work on my phone so sound quality and loudness is important to me which is rarely mentioned in reviews. I had a Alcatel Idol 3 and really enjoyed that phone besides its weaknesses (processor and memory). The H6X is an upgrade on the processor, memory, and OS software. All else is a wash from the I3. But as with all phones like that, the battery became a pain. I looked at the reviews for the Honor 6X and thought this would be a nice upgrade and I was not wrong. The H6X is the same size as the I3 for those video needs and a much faster processor was the main reason for the choice. Screen colors are not as vibrant but still quite nice. Speakers (Super strong point on the I3) are mainstream which in my mind means weak. Unless the speaker is pointing at you or into a hard reflector, the speaker at max volume is merely adequate. I will probably buy a bluetooth speaker if I really want to listen to music or books unlike the I3. I could put the I3 anywhere in my garage or even driveway and clearly hear what ever I wanted. Not so with the H6X. Otherwise, the phone is much faster with tasks, the OS software is a bit more intuitive than the Alcatel OS. One thing that is really annoying with my carrier (Cricket) is they only allow a small selection of phones to become hootspots and this phone is not one the them. This is pretty lame on Crickets part. That has nothing to do with the phone but if you are on Cricket or AT&T (Cricket's supplier) you likely cannot use the hotspot capability which I would assume the phone could easily handle.

                "review_text": "As someone who used his iphone 4s until last year Christmas it was about time for a change, and I needed something cheap. I always preferred Android but never bought an Android phone because I would never just throw away a perfectly working phone, but after 5 years of serving me well the screen finally stopped working. Instead of fixing the screen I bought the Honor 6x on sale for USD 140.00 and I've had this phone for 3 weeks, here are some thoughts for my first Android phone: 1) Build Quality: premium, despite the bottom/top to the back of the phone being plastic it feels like metal and looks like metal, it also adds to the lightness of it. It doesn't have that sweet 18:9 aspect ratio as but the device looks magnificent. Tweeting, gaming and watching videos/skyping my wife all feels natural. I would bring this phone rating down for no IP resistance but honestly at USD 140.00 it's worth it. I live in the Cayman Islands so I'm not gonna take it out to the beach and expose it to salt water (at all) and salty air for long periods of time (probably keep it in my bag when I'm with friends) but it has held up pretty good to dust etc especially with a screen protector. As far as durability goes, I dropped this phone at a height of about 3 ft by accident and there wasn't a single scratch on it and everything works fine but I'm not going to durability test it like JerryRigEverything haha (though on his review he shows that this phone is far more fragile than it seems but for USD 140.00 I'm totally fine with that as I treat my devices with care- I ironically say as I drop my phone within the first 3 weeks of purchase). 2) Display: The display is a vibrant 1080p and watching videos on this baby is wonderful. Some complain about the display being washed in colours but honestly I don't see it unless I compare it to an Samsung OLED screen (and even then it's still good). The screen itself is an LCD screen so it'll last longer and won't particularly suffer from burn-ins but you do have to be careful for light bleeding over the years. However, make sure to buy a screen protector on this because there isn't any real gorilla glass (that I can tell) as the screen will scratch rather easily, it comes with a plastic screen protector (because they probably know this) but buy a tempered glass screen protector ASAP as every day usage will scratch this device (thankfully I bought a pair with mine from OMOTON). 3) Interface: I'm not a fan of the EMUI skin, it looks bad and it didn't come with an app drawer (unless you upgraded to Nougat which I did after) but honestly it doesn't matter. I eventually downloaded Nova, Evie and Microsoft launchers and ended up using the Microsoft launcher and it makes the overall experience 100 times better. It feels like a clean, professional phone for both work and gaming and socialising with people I know. Widgets and the like are standard but I love the notification tab stylised by Huawei (super sleek). The fingerprint scanner is quick and accurate with seldom being unable to read my fingerprint but it's great. Please note that if you scratch the fingerprint scanner too much it will render it useless. The LED light in the top Bezel is nifty and easy to tell what's going on, nice and standard and the phone call speaker is completely flushed in line with the screen (and metal) making it not only look good but actually increase the phone lifespan by decreasing the likelihood of dirt etc from settling in. 4) Tasks: It's a quick/snappy device with smooth animations and gets every task I needed done. It packs 3gb of of RAM which allows you to have multiple tabs without slowing (I tried it out with about 10 apps running in background while I played Kingdom Hearts and it was still running fine @2gb RAM still free). I can run excel and create spreadsheets on this phone with relative ease and the splitscreen function works like a charm (on Nougat) when I'm on both twitter (Follow me @WaffleWhiskey ;)) and youtube, overall I haven't had any hiccups (except with the PPSSPP emulator). Primarily Gaming: Games from the appstore run fine but my main form of gaming is in emulation (Note I personally owned the physical games) It handles a lot of things pretty well. I couldn't run Dolphin Emulator to run Super Mario Sunshine for the Gamecube (runs at 4fps) however I've seen videos of people running dolphin on this device so I will try it again on different settings and update here. PSP games run well (30-35 fps with some hiccups here and there) but I've had to fiddle with the settings on the emulator (PPSSPP) to get Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep running perfectly (though gaming on a touchscreen for action rpgs like this is doable, but takes time to get used to). Overall this is fantastic (and yes it runs everything else in between like nes/snes/gbc/gba/nds/nintendo64- been playing Ocarina of Time @35 fps/psx- will test and update/ps2- will test and update though I doubt it will). 5) Camera: Easily the most impressive feature on a USD 140.00 phone. Dual camera setup (THAT ACTUALLY WORKS!- 12mp and 2mp) which is incredibly surprising on a midrange device like this but not only does it look impressive, but it actually is. Huawei did a good job with this camera, I'm not sure if Leica helped them to make this as they did with their other devices but there's nothing (official) said about it on the device. Images are sharp, well detailed and the colours are great which wasn't expected, video is captured at 1080p but it can be shaky if you don't have a steady hand without any Optical Stabilisation. The dual camera setup really adds depth, I wasn't expecting it at first but the photos really do look different when using that second shooter (great for taking pictures of my wife/son). The front facing camera is 8mp and does a fine job of selfies, the camera system/features are both wonderful and somewhat tacky at times with the beauty option but plentiful nonetheless. 6) Storage: At 32gb there's not a super crazy amount that you can do but honestly for someone who isn't into downloading a bunch of games/apps/videos this will be fine. I recommend getting another 32gb of storage (AT LEAST) if you're emulating big games like me/downloading a lot of music like me. I'm currently on a 16gb sd card on top of my phone but upgrading to 128gb in the near future. 7) Battery: Super good @3340 mAh it lasts me about 19-20 hours on a full charge with my brightness fully turned up, 25-27 hours on power saving mode and 80-100 hours on ultra battery saving mode (super impressive but only uses low power usage apps/basic phone functions/browser functions which is fine in this case). What it could've done better: 1) USB-C/Fast Charging- Note that this has Micro USB charging port 2) NFC- I don't use google pay etc but it would've extended its lifetime with me as I would use it in a few years (still on card and paper right now) 3) IP resistance of at least 66 would be appreciated but at this price point I won't complain too much 4) Remove that damned skin, it looks cartooonish and it's rather limiting and similar to iOS- make it an option not a mandatory thing 5) LTE support would be nice but GSM works fine and dandy 6) I don't care about 4k resolution video recording, I'm not a snob, I just wish there was SOME optical stabilisation 7) The build quality is superb for this price point but would appreciate metal buttons to give more satisfying clicks/feels but that's just me nitpicking, the phone's buttons feel great for being plastic and are still satisfying (but not quite as satisfying as metal buttons) 8) Replace the fingerprint scanner with a ceramic scanner, it's a better quality and is resistant to scratches but not too costly if only used on the scanner 9) A better glass for the screen as it's super easy to scratch which is also a huge threat to the front facing 8 mega-pixel camera 10) Follow me on twitter @WaffleWhiskey I know I'm shameless Thanks Amazon for the delivery and thanks Huawei for the fantastic phone!",

Got the newest Samsung Galaxy every time I signed the new contract so I am kind of spoiled. I like this phone just as much as any I've ever had. Feels great in my hand, very smooth and responsive. Doesn't lock up or have any glitches yet. Plays my games beautifully without slowing down. This phone is a fantastic value in my opinion. Moved from a contract plan to Cricket Unlimited. I couldn't be happier at this point. Some things a little different than the Androids I've been used to such as having to swipe the phone when inside an app to reach the back button. But figured out the differences quickly and as long as it keeps as tight as it's been up to this point I think I will be upgrading to the next Huawei every year. Great pictures also. Can't say enough about this affordable but yet flawless phone.",

The included whimpy plastic screen protector is eh, and many of the tempered glass screen protectors for this phone (or maybe in general) seem to have quality control issues with the edges not wanting to seal right, or having bubbles even after following directions correctly. Overall, amazing specs and camera for the price, but be extremely wary of ever dropping this phone, they didn't want to include gorilla glass even though budget phones like the Moto E4,etc have gorilla glass. Their Kirin cpu are actually stronger and better than the snapdragons I've read, so that's a big plus for what it's worth, and 3gb ram should be good for awhile. I ordered and installed a pretty good Spigen case which feels very tactile with its good buttons, but due to quality control issues and having to do a refund on a screen protector pack that wouldn't seal right and had bubbles even after following directions to a T, I'm very paranoid about dropping this thing by accident and having the screen crack in a million pieces due to a cost cutting measure by Honor to not include gorilla glass for some reason... in the end, great smooth phone but be VERY careful and make sure to get a good case and screen protector, I heard on non gorilla glass screen phones even putting it in your pocket is risking it getting scratched up,etc",

I was able to put my chip from Cricket in it and it worked without having to do anything. It also automatically collected all my info from my other phone as soon as I had put in my google account info. It comes with some really neat apps already installed like Huawei Health that tracks how many steps you have taken along with how many calories you have burned, it's pretty neat and not bulky. It also has app buttons that group certain apps together so you don't have a mess of apps all over your home screen. One has Google search, Gmail, Google maps, YouTube, Google Drive, Google Play Music, Google Play Movies and Tv, Google Photos and Google + all bundled together . The other group button has Weather, Calculator, Notepad, Recorder, Fm Radio, Flashlight, Mirror, Compass and backup and the next group app button has Twitter, CNN, Store, Honor Community, Support, and you can add more to it. It also comes with beautiful themes and each time i awaken the phone there is a new pretty picture on the screen. The screen is really clear and easy to see and the photos it takes are amazing even though I have yet to really learn all the functions. Phone specs are CPU Kirin 655 . 32 gb internal storage . resolution 1080x1920 , android version 7.0, EMUI 5.0.1 , RAM 3.0GB",

I specifically bought it, after hours of searching, reading reviews, and product comparison, because it was unlocked, and supposedly has a long battery life. IT WAS NOT FULLY UNLOCKED! Therefore I could use it with the provider I already bought a year of service with! I had already put on a glass screen cover, bought a case, and it didn't work right with my provider! As far as the battery life went... No. It did not have a 2 day battery life. It has a long battery life IF YOU DON'T USE IT. I could have it on for days without needing to charge it. The second I used it on wifi (which is the only way I COULD use it, since I didn't have phone service on it!!!), the battery drained pretty quickly. I am not one of those people constantly glued to my phone, either. Have you noticed that I speak of it in the past tense? That is because it is dead. Or, close enough to dead that it is unusable. Sometimes it works great - for a mini tablet that can't make calls - but sometimes it is completely unresponsive, and will not even power on or recognize a charger. I am out a phone, plus the money I paid for the screens, the case, AND a year of service (since I can't afford to buy a new phone to work with my service provider!). I am absolutely livid. I have been continually disappointed with businesses and purchases lately, including Amazon. This device was falsely labeled, as it is not fully unlocked, and the product itself doesn't even work. I already sent a message about this, and got no response. If I could give zero stars, I would.",

The screen display is very sharp. The camera is awesome. The battery life is as stated as it does last easily throughout the day on one charge. The phone reception is crisp and clear and loud. I dropped the phone by accident and not a scratch on the phone. The phone is very slim. The transition between applications and internet browsing is very smooth.

After two years, my last phone (Nexus 6P) was giving me about 30 minutes of screen time on a full charge, so having a phone that can last all day with moderate use is amazing. The battery life comes with a price, however: the processing power is underwhelming. I feel like for what I paid for, it's about as good as I should expect, but it's already lagging with some of the bigger apps. Snapchat in particular causes the phone to freeze. The camera is fine in adequate lighting, but is pretty poor in low light. Most of the reviews I read listed the main cons as being that this phone uses micro-USB instead of USB-C, which I personally prefer just because I like things to be standardized, and that the backing panel was plastic instead of metal. I don't know about most people, but I pretty much never take my phone out of its case, so backing material does not make a bit of difference to me.",

Bought Straight Talk Unlimited Data Plan, and using for internet service at work, since I shut down our line 2, that had the DSL on it. ATT wanted new contract to move to main phone line, for 2 years. We will likely be closing business sometime this year. So, I decided a budget cell phone as a HOT SPOT will do for now. And is working fine. I dont need lots of internet, and this is meeting my needs just fine. I really havent used this phone for anything else. But, I am surprised how well the battery lasts when i dont have it on the charger. But, is new. So, it should hold a charge very well. When it gets a year or two, on it will show just how well the battery ends up being. But for now, the phone has impressed me for what it is. Unit is about 1 month old at this time .. .. 03.20.2018 .. Update. Well, i had to send my personal cell phone in to get the battery replaced under warranty. So... that means i have been using this phone as my main cell phone in the mean time. Perhaps, i didnt understand the dual sim card limitations in the product description. and, it wasnt important at the time. What i have experienced is that you cant use but one sim at a time. basically, the other becomes inactive. Both wont function at the same time. So, may as well just shut one off, while the other is on. Am still using Straight Talk unlimited data as Hot Spot internet access at work, So, i cant used my personal ATT sim/phone number for texting of calling. Have to shut off the other sim first if i need to do that. So, If you need to use both sims, then, this isnt the phone to use. But, I am getting by since it should be just around 2 weeks that i will be w/o my personal phone, which, i can used one sim for data, and the other sim for talk and text. Hope this helps...",

I bought it from the Amazon warehouse as used-like new and can only imagine it was a post-Christmas return. My 6x arrived with the Dec 2016/B110 EMUI 4.1 level software but, once connected to wifi, it updated to B360 to B365 to B366 over the course of a day. The 6x supports Voice over LTE but does not currently support Voice over WiFi. My understanding is it is also missing the primary band for AT&T LTE service (17). Personally, I'm just fine with the phone having micro USB because it allows me to use my collection of various microUSB chargers instead of investing in newer USB C when I'm really only plugging the phone in for power. Maybe other folks do more data transfer via cables than I do. It's still not clear if this 6x will get a software update to Oreo. The successor (the 7x) is slated to and has hardware that is similar to the 6x. Fingers crossed that Huawei doesn't forget about the 6x phone, which came to the US in early 2017.",

I like that it comes with a phone manager app because the ones in the Play store all have ads. The call quality is decent with a FreedomPop sim that uses ATT. Call quality is also good on wifi. No complaints despite it being VoIP. I noticed other reviews say it isn't 4g LTE capable but it is. The camera is garbage and shouldn't be a selling point. Sometimes certain apps crash when first opened but work on the second attempt. The battery can also get hot while charging and idle, but not while in use, which is weird. The lack of other features don't bother me since it's a cheap budget phone. For the money it costs, it works far better than I expected.",

The manager behind the counter held the phone in her hands and expressed surprise at the build quality. She put it through its paces and asked \"What is Honor\"? I purchased the Huawei manufactured 32GB model with 3 gigs of ram. The phone is screaming fast with a 1080 X 1920 resolution. Had it for a couple of months. The 6X runs Android 7.0 Nougat. Storage, performance, camera quality and reliability makes this phone a must for customers looking for iPhone performance and reliability in a small price. Huawei is the real deal. Recently, Huawei had a pending deal with major American carriers blown up by lobbyists for \"other phone manufacturers\". If Huawei gets a foothold in the American market, the rising prices of certain handsets will freeze. There's a lot at stake. The stated reason for the deal going south was that Huawei is a Chinese manufactured phone. Amazon, thankfully, is truly \"free market\". Great phone.",

Normal great huawei camera app, plus one click apiture option to use second lense to record depth information. Then or after you take the picture, you can edit the picture and move the focal plane, have foreground or background in focus, or even have multiple focal planes. Splash is another nice photo edit option. Each time you apply one of these features it saves a new picture, and google photos finds them. Other pros: Fast and responsive phone. Lovely metal body. Great screen resolution. Gets google security updates ( Jan 2018 ) and is up to date Android. Fingerprintsensor is very fast, much faster than 5x. Camera focus is a bit slower than 5x. Comes with a plastic film screen protector factory installed. Amazing performance for the price. Cons: only 2.4 WiFi, but it works very well. 3 months later: great battery life, I use it a lot all day, on T-Mobile data and WiFi. Charge it every 2 days. Still seems to run fast, and up to date google security patch wise.",

I called customer services four or five time may be more of that, anyway very frustrated situation because the phone wasn't for me but a present that I had already promised to one of my nephew. The good news is that Amazon returned my money back into my card immediately. Anyway, I reordered the same phone from \"Newegg.com\" but I didn't know at the time that both of them (amazon and newegg) were using the same shipping and it took around twenty days and a lot of phone calls to received the small package with the phone. Guess what the phone came in the same amazon box and nothing was protected the phone inside the box. I think that the only reason the phone made in one piece is because it is all metal. Anyway, my nephew like it and according to him the battery can last for a couple days without recharged. Definitely, battery is the best feature in this device. Compare to Blue in the same price, Huawei is a better phone and this is my personal opinion.",

The only thing I've noticed is a bit iffy is how slow to react the keyboard is while typing in the messenger app. It only seems to be the keyboard as I've tried sliding my finger across all of the screen in other places and apps and it's just the keyboard.

And web browsing is pretty decent, but iphone is little smoother. Video quality is similar. Battery life is similar to my iphone(after 2 years of usage), for which I have no complain. For the price, this is an amazingly good phone. Just have to get used to gphone app/software. For me, the big advantage of gphone is its openness. I can transfer a lot of video+picture into/from the phone, very easily+quickly. Plus it is cheap to add 128G SD. And it works with AT&T wireless phone+data.

The phone is light, but it doesn't feel cheap, I like the aluminum back, though it appears it may scratch easily. The included front screen protector seems to be more than adequate and fits perfectly. The cameras are very nice, the rear 12 mp camera takes great shots, just haven't figured out what the second 2mp camera adds to the equation. I take lots of pictures but I'm not a techie when it comes to photograpy, I just know what looks good when I see it. I have played around with some of the filters and they are fun and easy to use. The slo-mo video works well, I just have nothing to compare it to I've never had that feature on a phone before. The front facing 8mp camera takes wonderful selfies, best I've ever shot with. Performance wise it seems to work great. I haven't had any issues with sluggishness, everything loads smoothly and quickly, probably due to the 3GB of ram. The battery is as advertised, I use a ton on GPS and navigation in my car on a daily basis, and the phone hasn't died on me yet, which is saying a lot and the main reason I bought it. Every previous phone I've ever had has never made it through a full work day using Google Maps, and this one does, nuff said. I've paid twice as much or more for phones in the past few years and have never been more satisfied than I am with this one. Lets just hope I don't break it, I've never had a phone for more than a 7 or 8 months without destroying it, I work on appliances for a living and always seem to figure out a way to break them.

Swapped the SIM card, turned on the phone, used the provided app to copy over all the apps from my old phone, and I was good to go! Would have been nice if I could have brought over all the configurations, too -- but I didn't see a way to do that. Not a big deal from my perspective. Functionally -- I'm really used to my Nova Launcher set up, so that was my first task after copying everything over. Once I got everything looking like I wanted it, I started poking around. It's a good phone -- great compared to the HTC Desire I switched from. I can hear well with it (hearing aid user), and it is plenty fast. As for look and feel -- wow. It's a solid phone!

I can easily get 2 days with normal use without location or Bluetooth turned on. I use both of those, which eats more battery, but by the end of the day (I get up at 3am and go to bed at 8:30pm) I still have 30% or more battery. - Camera. Not the best I've ever used, but for a $200 phone, it exceeds all my expectations. I'm a photographer and a good camera was important to me, and I am not unhappy with it. Like I said, it's not the best I've had, but it's good. - Screen. It's nice and bright with good colors. Cons: - Speaker. It's very quite. Nothing impressive. - It doesn't have USB Type C.

This is an update to my previous note: I received the Huawei phone, after checking the sound ,I realized that even though it appears that the device has 2 speakers, sound only comes out of the right hand side. Thinking that this was a defect, I returned the phone. Upon receiving the replacement, I did another test of the sound, and the same thing happened. Sound is emitting from only one speaker on the right hand side. This has lead me to conclude that this is how the device was actually manufactured. If I am wrong, then I must be the most unfortunate person I know. The opening on the left side seems to be just a prop and nothing else. I am a bit disappointed as the advantage of having both speakers would greatly enhance the experience. Apparently, its a microphone, not a speaker.",

Only trouble I had was the tethering option - setting the mobile hotspot was easy, connection is stable but...after couple of weeks there was no internet access. Other devices connect to the AP, but cannot access the internet. Tried the SIM card in a different phone - no problem with the network, everything worked. Phone was replaced with another Honor 6x, after initial set-up everything worked great...for couple of weeks,.. then again no internet access trough the hotspot. I can only speculate about the issue, definitely it's not the mobile network (Cricket), since there are no problems with my new phone (unlocked Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro). I guess the Honor 6x, even though unlocked, has some piece of software allowing the mobile network determine it's a carrier sold phone and blocks the tethering ability. I also tried USB and Bluetooth tethering, same outcome. Returned the phone to Amazon for a refund. Otherwise, if you don't intend to use it as a hotspot, it's a great phone for budget money.",

The battery drops about 15% over a 24 hour period. Installing apps on the 5X took a while, but on the 6X installation flies! Oh, yes, the problem I had with mobile data on my 5X. I had the same problem on the 6X initially and had to go to a local AT&T store. It took them about an hour to figure out the mobile data on my account had been restricted for a reason nobody would explain. They removed the restriction and the 6X is working perfectly!

The screen resolution is great, gaming specs are great, the camera is only good, User Interface/Learning curve is great & Finally the battery life is excellent (2 days with moderate to heavy usage with battery saver on). I feel like I paid under $200 for a flagship phone. I know Huawei makes other (high end) phones but for now I will stick with the Honor series, because for what you get & what you pay it's a no-brainer.",

                "review_text": "I bought this to replace my Zenfone 2 ze551ml. The ZF2's screen started failing, so I figured I had to buy a new handset, but didn't want to spend a lot on a new sim-free device. The Honor 6x fit the bill. Compared to the ZF2, the Honor 6x is almost as snappy. Gaming-wise, look elsewhere as it will not impress - there's definitely lag when gaming. Then again, if you're considering this phone, you aren't looking for a gaming powerhouse anyway. You also don't need to buy a screen protector --- it comes with one installed right out of the box. The Honor 6x also feels like a high-end phone when held since it's a metal-unibody handset. Try finding that on another $200 phone. As soon as I finished the initial setup, the phone prompted to update to EMUI 5.0, which is Android Nougat 7.0. The update was about 2.x GB. Some folks are complaining about a drop in performance, but my handset never had that. In fact, I find it faster. The settings menu also got an overhaul and more options are available at your disposal. A tip, though: DO NOT CUSTOMIZE YOUR HONOR 6X'S UI IF YOU PLAN TO UPDATE TO NOUGAT. Install the update first, then customize the look and feel of the phone later. The LCD display is nice. You'll also be able to choose the screen's color temperature if you find it too \"cool\" like I did. Audio quality-wise, calls, music, and videos all sound clear. The fingerprint scanner is QUICK. Unlocking the phone via that method is almost instantaneous. I can't say much about the camera as I have yet to test it. But for low-light shoots, the photos lose some detail as far as I can tell. There isn't much bloatware either, which makes it clean. Love the battery performance --- out of the box, with 54% capacity, it drained to only 43% after I downloaded apps, synced e-mails, personalizing the settings, and transferring files between two phones. That's with around 2.5 hours of screen time. Color me impressed. As for connectivity, the modem is pretty solid. No matter where I go, I always get full bars, and compared to the ZF2, LTE performance is way better. Overall, for a handset that's around $200, I love it. Again, not a gaming powerhouse, but for everything else, it gets the job done.",

Only a small dent on the corner Cons: -Really feels like it wants to be an iPhone. The settings, no app drawer (you can change after the update). It all feels very similar to iOS, which i'm not fond of. Luckily it is an android phone, and you can tweak the settings to make it feel like a more traditional android experience instead. -Slippery -Comes with a screen protector on it from the factory, but mine was not applied correctly and a large part of the screen was exposed, and some of the sensor was covered. Other thoughts: A bit bigger than i thought it would be. I have small hands, and it can be cumbersome to handle one handed. Back is rather cold to the touch. Not a bad thing, just an observation.

I once owned a Huawei phone back when they first started selling in America. The orginal phone i had was of cheap material, very slow performance, and was not at all what i hoped for. Then about 2 weeks ago I decided i was fed up with my iPhone, and wanted to make the switch to Android, and was in the market for something reasonably price, yet very functional. As everyone else does I went to online, and began researching what would be the best option for my needs. There are so many options available for consumers it may be a hassle for someone to make the choice, so the decision of Huawei with its gleaming reviews. I decided I would have given it a shot due to the price and UI. It is only running Android 7.1 Nougat which is a little disappointing, but with the merging of EMUI which is Huawei's UI it has not let me down yet. The phone honestly has an amazing screen for being 1080p 5.5\" inch display, a wonderful processor which is a little old but still holds up, and a battery that suprisingly lasts me almost 2 days with a single charge. The phone is a great choice if you aren't looking for the latest and greatest, because being almost 2 years old it is still able to hold its own against even the newest smartphones.",

                "review_text": "Dear review reader If you've come this far , you are probably interested in a mid range mobile phone that wont break the bank and wont get you to break in tears. On both of these aspects I can attest , with this phone you will find just that . The Honor 6X is actually a 2nd Gen. 5X , a device which I have owned prior to upgrading to this second generation. When I'm looking at a successor to a 1st gen phone , I want to see significant improvements , and a lot of them . one might ask , how many improvements can a company possibly introduce in a 2nd gen phone while keeping a price point that will justify them ? Huawei's Honor brand has managed to do that gracefully. A mobile device experience is much more than an accumulation of specs , but just to get that out of the way so that we can understand the baseline performance and abilities of this device: 5.5 1080P IPS panel at almost 72% screen to device ratio with 403PPI (I don't know about you but its becoming more and more of a thing these days and will remain a thing for the future) Hisilicon Kirin 655 octa core processor at 2.1 GHz 32 GB on board storage (twice the base storage vs. the 5X ) EMUI 5.0 (Android 7.0 Nougat , Vs. EMUI 4.0 for the 5X) 3 GB RAM (50% more than the 5X at 2GB) Dual 12MP+2MP 1080P rear facing camera with LED Flash , 8MP 1080P front facing camera Rear mounted Finger print sensor which is blazing fast Dual Sim Micro SD storage expansion (supports up to 256GB) 3340 mAh Batter (vs. 5X 3000 mAh) all metal build All of the above translate to an experience that I can only describe as total joy. Android 7.0 dressed up in Huawei's EMUI skin (which I like a lot but is a matter of preference) runs smooth and fast on this device with plenty of ram for multitasking and juggling open apps (have not tried gaming but basic games will surely work smoothly with the GPU on board) the build is tight , substantial , light enough (for a 5.5 Inch phone) and for a price point of $199 ... no less than phenomenal with curved back to slim the device's edges and polished smooth display and bezels. Battery life is a vast improvement on an already great performance of the 5X , lasting easily a full day (and I'm talking 7AM to 11PM not 5PM ) with 50% at least left after substantial usage (media , texting , calls , social media in the background with messages etc.) The display is sharp and crisp , with Huawei's very good and high quality color and saturation levels that are customizable in the settings . Oh and about that camera , I am not familiar with a lot (or any for that matter ) phone brands that sport a dual camera at these price points and it wasn't put there for show just to check that check box . The camera produces VERY ! impressive shots at decent to very good lighting conditions , with a bundle of configurable settings including Bokeh (Boca) effect (Depth of field) that look absolutely amazing even before taking into consideration they were taken with a $199 mid range phone. Low light performance is good thanks to the led flash , however will not reach levels of pricier phones out there (you know who I'm talking about) The performance of the camera is snappy , quick , easy and with so many options embedded in the camera app to fill all the average user needs. The finger print sensor is not only fast and on point , Huawei also includes finger print gesture options to control different controls such as notification pull down , camera etc. My personal and only two drawbacks which are very specific are micro USB 2.0 (instead of USB Type C) and lack of NFC for mobile payment , however if I'm being honest , taking into consideration all of the advantages along with the excellent price point ... are fairly negligible . in conclusion , as a daily driver , this phone is a joy .

I got the version running nougat and everything transferred over just fine from my sd card, phone calls and gps fpr my ridesharing apps worked well too. However this a warning for anyone running google appa and is on tmobile. The 6x does not appear to consistently be able to open google apps like, gmail, waze, newsstand, etc. They either close immediately upon opening or close when you do your first press or swipe. Tech support suggested trying another carrier but of course that is a luxury most people don't have time or money for. So just be forewarned, although I know a number of people who love and use the product, you may have a lot of heartburn in store if you're one of the ones where not all apps function. That being said, the return seems to be going seemlessly, I just don't have a substitute phone for the next few days.",

                "review_text": "I'm the mean mom that makes my kids buy their own smart phones. My daughter had her eye on an iPhone 6S, although she really wanted the 6S Plus for the larger screen. She saved and saved, but decided she wanted a phone sooner rather than later - so she'd have to do an iPhone SE or consider android phones. Since screen size was an important feature for her, I did some research and ran across the Honor 6X. It seemed like a perfect fit - it had everything that was important to her, except iMessaging/Facetime, and it left her with plenty of money in the bank. We also liked that cases and screen protectors were reasonably priced too. She has had the phone now for two months. She has absolutely no regrets, which also means her friends (that all seem to own an iPhone 6 or later generation) thought it was cool too. I have to say that as a 6S owner myself, I too am quite impressed with everything she got in a phone for $250. I love the fingerprint scanner on the back, her pictures are quite good and battery life is much better than on my phone. I like that it has 32GB storage and that it can be extended by micro SD card - it integrates just as seamlessly as if it is all internal storage. Call quality has been good, reception in our metro area has been fine, although I can't speak to how it does in more rural areas as we haven't been off the beaten path since owning the phone. I've seen quite a few complaints about the UI, but I have none, perhaps because it feels similar to the iPhone experience, which is what we are used to. The processor is nice and speedy, no lagging or hanging so far. The phone seems pretty durable, keeping in mind that it has a glass screen protector and a slim case on it. My daughter cracked the screen protector the first weekend she owned it, but otherwise she has not managed to cause damage to the phone itself - and this is a teen that is tough on her belongings. I know it has seen multiple drops already. If I didn't have a company issued phone and was spending my own money, this is what I'd get! The only features I would miss is iMessaging, live pictures and Apple Pay. It looks very likely that my oldest daughter will choose to update her phone and get one of these too. I very highly recommend this phone. Update: The phone is now four months old, and my daughter accidentally left it in her pocket when she got into the pool. She immediately realized what she had done and we took it out of the case, dried it and put it in rice for several days. The phone boots up like normal, but the touchscreen is non responsive. We then popped off the back for better airflow and let it sit for several more days. After a week of dry time, the touchscreen still wouldn't work. The repair is $150. We're still waiting for the parts to come in, but the technician seemed very confident that it will be as good as new when he's done. While I realize that it is my daughter's own fault for getting her phone wet, we have had many phones get wet in our household, even completely submerged, and this is the first one that has actually required a repair. This experience has not changed my mind about the value of this phone, I would still have my daughter buy it. However, knowing that it is perhaps not as durable as our other phones, I would definitely have purchased an additional warranty for it in retrospect.",

I saw some You Tube videos showing that the screen is not resistant to scratching so bought a screen protector and a case (Remex Honor 6X Case Stand with Kickstand) right away. Overall a solid feeling phone. It was lagging at first so I backed up my SD card that was previously formatted on a Samsung and formatted it in the Honor 6x, formatted it in the Honor, put stuff back on it and now no lagging. Bluetooth would randomly disconnect so had to restore it to factory settings which fixed the issue but should have been first thing since it was a previously used phone. The finger print recognition feature on the back is SO convenient, works great to unlock the screen plus has different options on what to control like scrolling through pictures showing notifications, and it can be used by some Apps to confirm purchases instead of using a password. My gripes are that the ring tone and notification tone are together, they should be separate, sometimes at night I only want text messages and like to turn ringer all the way down. Also the alarm volume can not be set for each individual alarm so had to find one from the Google Play called \"Alarm\". Also installed \"Nova Launcher\" which is much more customizable than the default launcher. For the price a really nice phone.",

If I had to buy it for the $185ish it's currently at, I'd consider spending the extra $15 and getting the Moto G5 - but, I assume that's Amazon's thinking as well.... I currently use Cricket because the plan is super cheap for 5 lines, includes tax and this device works great with the ATT / Cricket service. I purchased the ZTE Blade Max from Cricket for relatively the same cost as this - plus a $25 \"upgrade:\" fee.... I had to take the ZTE back within 3 days because of the horrible delay and lag on day one.. The camera quality is great for this inexpensive of a device. The screen size and clarity is perfect for me and it is also very responsive The Fingerprint reader is very fast - though most are these days. The Speed is quite nice - Though it is still day one - but relatively 0 lag opening any apps standard apps. I do no gaming so I cannot review that. The I like buying the non-carrier phones like this because of the options to do things such as Wifi Tether without purchasing extra plans just to use the limited data I already pay for. As well, because of the ability to remove bloatware apps pre installed easily. The only cons I have so far is the EMUI launcher is not easily pushed aside by other Launchers and you need to take a few extra steps to change to Nova or others, but it's still not that big of a deal. Also, No VOLTE or WIFI Calling with carriers on 3rd party devices - but you should know that prior to purchase! Can you get better phones for this price? Yes and no. You can certainly go purchase a used HTC M9, Galaxy S6 or LG G4 used and have a better device that was considered a Flagship just a few years ago which means loads of better specs all around. But, they are used and you will almost definitely have issues with them. You can even get the Nextbit Robin brand new for even less than this, which has quite a bit better internal specs, but a worse camera, screen, no expandable memory and just overall bad design. However - For the price of this phone, compared to the others (If purchasing for the $149 like I did) it's worth it. I wouldn't get this at the current cost, because of the other better options at the $200 price point.",

The Huawei flavor of Android is nice and clean.. updated to the latest version of android, while many pricier phones are still working on older versions.. Split screen is great, as I can watch youtube, while surfing facebook or the internet... I use this now more than my tablet great buy !",

The Honor 6X is more than capable of performing any tasks the average person needs, and the price is almost hard for me to comprehend given the up-to-date tech available in this device. Screen is acceptably vibrant, camera is very powerful, fingerprint reader is fast and easy, battery life is surprisingly robust... there are almost no downsides to this phone unless you NEED the latest and greatest tech. The price of the phone is evident in the build quality. The overall strength of the phone is below the standards set by other flagships from Apple, Samsung, etc. The screen is also made of a more affordable type of glass that is considerably less scratch resistant than those using the latest Gorilla Glass. Beware of spare coins, keys, or other potential hazards because they will most definitely destroy your screen. Just be careful how abusive you are with the phone and everything should be fine. Besides, if you are looking at this phone then it is obvious you are looking for a good deal. I would take this phone any day over the money-devouring iPhone X or Galaxy S8.",

Sure, if I worked for the NSA/CIA/FBI/whatever, I wouldn't use it--but then I'd have a government-provided secure phone probably, too! I'll take my chances that the Chinese government is less than concerned about what I do on my phone. If you're on the fence, google it and read what the experts say--I was comforted by what I read.

The camera especially can open up slow, although once opened, it makes great pictures. One can notice after a while, that the operating system is still having rough edges and some empty or unused options points to being very new, very much like still in beta testing. It does look nice, once to be like Apple, but again, given the fact, that phone has 3GB of RAM to utilize, something just slows it down, like it only has 1GB. The battery life is phenomenal. I couldn't believe my eyes that it was still on 86% after several hours and medium heavy usage, while my Note 5 was already at 55%. Give yourself an even greater boost by disabling apps you will not use. Despite all the positives, I can't give more than 3 stars, because they really need to work on that OS.

Voicemails stopped too. After doing a ton of research, resetting the phone, getting a new SIM, it came down to a hardware issue. I contacted Huawei support and was told I would be sent an RMA label under warranty. Two weeks later, still nothing. Called again, was told it was never sent and that they would send it next day air. Another week passes, still nothing. I call again, apparently the last two times they failed to enter my information correctly! Finally, two days after the third call, I receive an email with the RMA label. It took nearly a month to send an email?! I send the phone to Huawei under warranty and two days later, I get a package from them. Excited that they had fixed my phone, I'm shocked to see a letter stating my warranty is void \"due to water damage.\" I've never exposed my phone to water and never had others handle my phone where this could have happened. This is a blatant cop-out. I called them up for the fourth time and am told it would be \"reviewed\" and I would be contacted shortly. Another week later and no contact, I've given up on this being resolved, and will not be buying another Huawei product. Buyer beware if you have any issue and expect them to fix it!",

I am very pleased. The $200 price tag was great. Didn't really feel like spending $700 on another galaxy phone and took a leap of faith. I read pretty much all the reports on this phone before purchasing. To me I can't really tell the difference between the camera on this and the S7 other than maybe the low light??? I don't take many selfies, but I did tonight only cause I bought a Halloween mask and wanted a pic. The phone responds well. Have had no issues. It comes with a screen protector, not glass, I didn't know this, but I vaguely remember I may have read that. I had purchased the sparin tempered glass protectors as well. I only tried to put one on last night. It didn't work great. I only tried one out of the 2 pack. But wasn't really happy with it. I wrote Sparin. They wrote me back instantly. They are sending me two more free of charge as they said there had been a couple issues and want to resolve the issue. They also said if it doesn't they are coming out with a new product soon that should be even better and will give it free of charge or will refund me (their customer support is excellent). I also bought the cheap, flexible, clear phone protector. Love it. It came in a two pack as well for about $7 or $8 dollars I think. I bought a prepaid AT&T sim and have had no issues with it. Other than the fact I hardly have service here with them, but I knew that before hand. I've heard conflicting issues about Verizon and Tmobile working on this unlocked phone with 2 sim slots. I will try out Verizon tomorrow just to see what happens. Overall, I give it a 4 only because ...well,no particular reason, just probably something I'm missing and if you're like me I like to read all the ratings and sometimes I don't believe all the 5 star ratings. I know as long as it keeps working the way it has been I will contine to purchase the newest phone's from Huawei!! That is for sure. I am very impressed.",

                "review_text": "I will say up front I purchased this phone as a temporary replacement phone for my Samsung Galaxy 7 Edge while waiting repair and I was NOT expecting an \"apples to apples\" comparison of devices but this phone really only gets 2 Stars from me because it serves the purpose of basic function until I can get my Samsung back. I literally struggle with myself to not throw this phone at the wall or out the car window EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! I will list just a few of my personal complaints/issues below along with a few pros. Pros: Great color Good picture quality Good Android (not phone) functionality Easy out of the box to use set up Good call and sound volume Cons: Lag time opening apps ~ esp camera Apps crash mid operation Processing speed is slow at best....videos, songs always pausing, buffering When using \"back\" button from any app phone will oftentimes take you to random apps that you were not in rather than back one page ie...Google search, press back button and phone takes you back to a random text message or email ( this happens so frequently that this is my single most irritating glitch of this phone) When I try to answer phone it drops calls and vise versa. Sometimes call choice is a slide selection and other times it's a button selection of whether to accept or decline, very aggravating. I end up having to call everyone back because I hang up on them no matter how I select to accept the call. Again, this may be my experience in using Samsung devices and their superiority in function that makes me dislike this phone so bad but in my opinion I would not recommend this phone to any adult who needs to conduct business matters or does much on their device other than minimal calling and texting. This is just not your device.",

I searched for hours for a phone in my price range that would be a good quality phone, that took a nano sim and a slot for a micro SD card for extra storage, and this had it. Plus, I am not in a cell phone plan, I'm just using this as a gophone for at&t. I am SO happy with this purchase. The camera is absolutely AMAZING. I take a ton of pictures and I am so pleased with the camera and all the features. You won't be disappointed. I went out on a limb buying this and I am so glad I did.",

Positive of this phone is build quality,and excellent battery life(5-6 screen on time).The area it really stood out for me is in performance it is really amazing for the price and keeps up very well doing everyday task.My negatives about that phone would be speakers are really just to low for most sanarios,camera is good for the price range.I found images to always lack a tad bit of sharpness and colours are dull,there is a option to increase contrast so it helps a bit.Other things such as screen,front facing camera are on par with the competition.My biggest concern about this device I the lack of nougat update which Honor promised in March but still isn't hear.Hauwei/Honour doesn't have the best record for keeping phones updated keep this in mind before purchasing.",

The downside is that the aperture settings don't work well when you have multiple people in the frame. It'll focus on one person or object only. Great for taking photos with a single subject. The phone is fast, and supports 4g LTE for ATT. I have never owned a dual sim phone with that capability. It's nice moving up from H+. 32 gigs, and about 9 gigs of it is bloatware. Overall performance is very good! Great phone especially for the price. A lot of people were astonished that I only paid about $180 for it.",

Several phones employees have bought off eBay have been banned from using our employer's Wi-Fi because of this. However, this phone has never once popped up with security warnings.

                "review_text": "There is no debate. This phone offers the most bang for the $150 bucks that I bought it for. Aluminum unibody, dual cameras, Touch ID, 5.5\" full HD display, thin bezels, great OS, octa-core processor, 32GB internal storage, dual SIM, 3GB RAM, and a 3300 mAh battery. It can take gorgeous photos. Wide aperture mode actually works, looks impressive and adds a little \"wow\" factor to your images. Touch ID sensor on this phone is faster than on many flagship phones, including the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8. Both EMUI 4.0 and 5.0 are polished, neat, quick, and easy to use. The screen can be split to use two apps at once. Little to no unnecessary processes going on in the background. No app compatibility issues due to EMUI so far. The included storage sense and RAM optimization software is useful. Also includes many of the latest features; hotspot, screen recorder, eye comfort, resolution optimization, and Miracast among others. Unlike many others in this price range, this phone won't get uncomfortably hot after a while of usage, the processor is fast enough to handle multiple apps at once, the large amount of RAM won't make your phone crash if you multitask too quickly, and the back cover won't go flying off when you drop it because there is none. The large battery complements the large display. I use power intensive apps regularly from the moment I wake up at 6 AM, until 5 PM when I arrive home, and there is always 40% or more power remaining. The closest competitor there was when I bought the Honor 6X was the Moto G5 at $200... After using this one for a day, it worked as expected, and I was glad I made the right choice. The newer Honor 7X has now been released, so make sure to look into that phone before buying this one. I trust that it will improve over its predecessor.",

I make calls, send texts, use it for my GPS and some browsing. That's it. I don't game or stream. For what I do, this phone fits my needs perfectly. I love the size. I had a Nexus 6 that was just too large, and a Samsung Alpha that was just a bit too small. This one feels comfy in my pocket, with a screen size I like. It's also reliable, well, so far. My last 3 phones have died due to HW issues. Maybe this one will too, but 3 months in, it hasn't gotten the least bit buggy on me. That's really all I care about. I want a phone that works and has a decent battery. Oh, I also need a phone that gets regular patches and updates or my company wont let me access my work email. Huawei seems to have a good record of doing that, and so far I have not been denied access. So all in all, I'm giving it 5 stars as of 8/24. You can rest assured that if this review is still 5 stars on the day you're reading it, it's still working for me. The day this phone dies, I will post it here and update accordingly.",

It has an awesome user interface (updates to EMUI 5.0), great display, sound, app drawer, etc. I had recently purchased the Blu Life One X2 and that phone is a joke compared to the Honor 6x. I've also owned an Iphone 6x Plus and this is definitely on par. The octo-core processor is clearly doing it's job, this phone is incredibly responsive. I connected it to my car's bluetooth with no problem. The Honor 8 has a faster processor and better camera, but the 6x is not far behind. 09/14/2017 update The phone kept getting seriously sluggish on me. A number of bugs kept it from working as it should have. Had a hard time reselling the phone, finally gave it away.",

                "review_text": "I love this phone! After owning four Blu products -- and after all four developed issues -- I stepped out on faith and tried this Huawei. Two of the power ports on Blu phones loosened over time and the phones refused to take a charge...VERY FRUSTRATING! After a few months of use, the connector on the Honor seems solid and I'm confident I won't have the same issue. The performance of this phone is excellent for the money! It runs rings around the comparable Blu product for speed, multi-tasking and battery life. I'm a pretty heavy social media user; I check Facebook about 3 or 4 times daily and I've never had to plug in during the day. I also use it to stream radio from time to time, and it holds up well there too. And when I realize I've been streaming for a few hours and check my remaining battery life, it will fully charge from about 25% to full in about 30-45 minutes. The Hauwei Android interface is well designed. A nice feature is it automatically shows weather for dual locales as you travel, i.e., it always shows your \"home\" weather, and if you drive 30 miles away, you'll see the weather for that town or suburb too. My only criticism is launching the camera and the flashlight. The flashlight is especially frustrating because it takes multiple taps to engage it, then to shut it off. I haven't spent enough time learning the camera -- and maybe I was so used to using the camera on the Blu that it became second nature -- so that's on me to familiarize myself more with the features and functions. The pictures I have taken are very, very nice though...even low-light interiors show pretty good detail. In the sub $200 price range, this is a winner!",

I can't explain how frustrating this is when I need my navigation or I'm doing something for work and I'm not around wifi, which I shouldn't need to be.

I have unlimited everything on my phone plan and have never had any problems in the past with my other phones.

Comes with bloatware, but some are uninstallable, and with 32GB of storage, I can simply kill-off, I mean disable, the rest of the apps I don't want and leave them, rather than try to root the phone so I can fully uninstall them and free up ROM. This also leaves the warranty intact, so I can update to new versions still. EMUI is a fairly stock experience, but if you don't like it you can install your own launcher and use that instead. I prefer Nova Launcher myself, because it has the scrolling app dock, et al. I have Earth & Moon Pro wallpaper installed and turned up to maximum quality, which takes up a lot of resources, yet I've had no issues, unless I'm running a lot of apps in general. The phone is incredibly thin despite it's huge battery, which is very nice, and the speakers are above average, maybe even excellent if you bounce the sound off an object. The screen has bright, vivid colors when turned up all the way, although the colors dull if you dim the display. There are a few minor cons, although the worst is that with the EMUI, I cannot install a screensaver and can only do a slideshow as the screensaver, no matter what app I try to install to fix it. Pros: EVERYTHING! (Except for the cons below) Seriously, it's a fantastic phone. You've looked at the specs right? Here's what I like the most, -Price -Great day/night rear camera. No, of course it's not DSLR quality, but it's sharp, and fully featured, with all sorts of pro and fun shooting modes. -Front camera is 8MP. -Thin and light. -Huge battery, easily lasts over a day. -Above average speakers. -Price! -Huge ROM, RAM, processor, and full array of sensors (look at the specs). -Has the second latest Android version (latest hasn't hit any but a few manufacturers yet, but Nougat is barely any older). -HONOR is a great name. ;) -Almost forgot: Speedy, accurate fingerprint sensor. (Can be a little slow if you don't wake up the device first.) -It has a audio jack!!! (Apple, I'm looking at you.) -It has the radio chip enabled, so you can listen to the actual radio if you open the app and have a plug in the audio jack. (Yes, that's a thing. Look it up. I'm looking at you again Apple, and other large phone manufacturers.) -DID I MENTION THE PRICE?! I had $200 as the highest I was willing to pay for a new phone, and also a list of features I wanted. Wherever I looked, the price was either way too high or the specs just weren't up to what I was looking for and/or were mixed reviews. This phone has more than I could have dreamt of, and was within budget. It's a great deal for a phone that can actually kind of rival the latest iPhones. Cons: I only have a few minor complaints, -Extremely limited screensaver options, and additional apps don't help. -Wide aperture enhancements don't look natural. Regular shooting mode has good depth though when an object is selected to focus on. Most enhanced aperture cameras don't work great anyway though. -Large footprint. The large display is nice to look at and type on, but is a little tall for some pockets. Just something to get used to though. However, I would be willing to add 10% to the width if it could be scaled down 10% (to preserve battery capacity). -Screen resolution is great (Full HD), but still not optimum if you love or want to tinker with Google Cardboard 3D viewing or similar. 4K is needed for a clear picture in the 3D viewers. -2.5D display looks and feels great, but makes it difficult or impossible to find screen protectors that fit. Not sure how scratch resistant the phone screen actually is, but I've been using it without a screen protector for a few months with no problem. -Colors on the display dull if the screen is dimmed. -Radio app could use a couple extra features, such as scrolling name of station and song, as well as better reliability when run in the background. I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a new phone, regardless of budget. Actually the 7X is out now, and is even better at the same price (although I still slightly prefer this one because the camera on the 6X is centered instead of to the side). What I would recommend to Huawei in their future generations of phones: -Fix the cons stated above, except for the 2.5D edge. The curved edge is really nice, even if it makes finding screen protectors hard. -Keep the camera centered - it helps for finding macro shots and for mounting as a gun camera (for those who would). -Move the fingerprint sensor to the power button. Others are starting to do that and it's both natural and easy to trigger without picking up the phone. -Add a speaker to the top. That would add stereo audio in landscape mode. That can be forward facing, but if they remain outward facing, the sound can be bounced off a couple objects on each side for enhanced audio. -Keep doing what you're doing with upgrading the software. -Make the SIM tray accept micro as well as nano sim for convenience. Maybe provide two different SIM trays? -On a slightly more expensive model, I would like to see added: -Add in a gyroscope and pressure/temperature sensor in addition to the ones you have in there. -Change the micro USB to USB-C. -Add wireless charging. -Pull in the specs from the Honor 8 (of course).",

                "review_text": "I was sceptical about buying a phone online especially when I couldn't ask questions about it or visibly touch or see it before buying. But when my 4th iPhone crashed /broke beyond repair, I was not willing to spend the same money again. That is when I researched this Huawei honor 6x phone, I read the reviews and also asked people with Huawei model phones and they all appeared very happy with them. It was very tempting considering you get the same if not a better phone for a fraction of the price. I have to say when I received this phone, I was pleasntly surprised and very impressed with it. It feels expensive, the screen is a lot bigger than what I had before and the picture and camera quality is the best I've ever had. The sharpness and colour of the pictures is fantastic. It is much better than any of the iPhone cameras I've had before. I love that there is a fingerprint sensor which allows you to open apps and use the phone more quickly. It is also better for security reasons. Overall it is an excellent phone, I would recommend to anyone who is sick of iPhone constantly breaking/crashing. I promise you, you won't regret it. And you'll save yourself a lot of pennies. If it breaks tommorow, I would buy it again. As many people have complimented my photos and asked if I used a professional camera. You won't be disappointed.",

                "review_text": "I have mixed feeling about this phone. I currently have a iPhone 6S plus as a personal phone. Although, I was issued an iPhone 6 4.7\" from my company, the screen was just a bit small to read and it only came with 16 GB. I take a lot of pictures when I go to the field so the lack of storage and the ability to expand are major problems. Since it is for company use, I didn't want to spend a lot of money and having an Android phone would be nice compliment to the iPhone. I previously owned a Honor 5X and for the price ($120), I really couldn't complain about the features but the constant lags were a huge problem. The processor of the 5X was just too slow. I read that the 6X has a much faster processor and its comes with 32 GB internal storage and 3 GB of rams. Based on the spec, the 6X is a much improved phone. Since I received the phone two weeks ago, I have taken it with me on two company trips and so far so good. There were still occasional lags but not significant. I have done speed tests on the iPhone 6S plus and the Honor 6X, the iPhone performed better in app opening and web page loading but not by much. The fingerprint sensor on the 6X is very responsive and fast and I like it much more than the iPhone 6S plus. I just wish that there are more Android apps with fingerprint unlock available. Also, I notice the 6X has a much brighter screen and colors are more rich than the 5X. So, why the 1 star reduction? For the $80 price difference between the 5X (currently $170) and 6X, the improvements were noticeable but not substantial. The dual cameras make little improvement to the picture quality. During low light condition, 6X photo quality is still not great. For the price, I can deal with no NFC but the wifi is still N and not AC which is pretty much the standard. There is also no OTG support. I tried to output media content to a TV via a OTG cable and the 6X did not support it. Conclusion, the 6X is a good but not a great phone for $250. I think $200 is more appropriately priced. The bright 5.5\" 1080p, expandable memory storage, fingerprint sensor and metal casing are pluses. The lack of AC wifi and OTG support don't justify the $80 price increase from the 5X. At the end, I went for the LG G5. This phone comes with AC wifi, 4 GB ram, NFC and 32 GB internal storage. The only negative is the screen is only 5.3\" which is a bit smaller in comparison to the Honor 6X. I got a \"Like New\" condition one from eBay for $210.",

If you forget to charge your phone, no worries because this phone is equipped with fast charging and within minutes your ready to go. The overall build feels premium with the gold metal rear and glass front, and it's also sturdy with a few drops to the ground no scratches or dents yet. the only thing neither one of us are a huge fan of is the slight lag of the camera when taking pictures. The Honor comes with two lenses which helps capture really clear and bright colors... when the image is still and you don't move because of the camera lag, hard to take pictures of energetic baby on the move with a camera the lags since on my Galaxy S6 I can capture pictures quickly with out blur. but this phone is also not expensive, and for one small drawback the Honor 6x is an amazing phone for the price and performance.

The system runs very slowly and most of my apps do not work efficiently with it. Often times the phone freezes and my apps force close. In particular, this phone is especially horrible when using snapchat. It forces close almost everytime, it lags taking photos, it lags sending photos, it lags opening the keyboard and typing, it doesn't sense when you use the drawing tool, and once snapchat stops working the whole phone stops working. In addition, the camera quality could be MUCH better. I recently experienced the phone being on volume despite the fact that I had it on silent and the headphones were in. The lock screen changes to an old lock screen and flips the image sideways when the system UI forces close (which is often especially after using snapchat) so that I have to restart it constantly.

Pros ** Fingerprint Scanner- Snappy fast high quality. * Camera - Slow to take pictures, and mid level results (that's great for something 250 and under) Decent battery life - I have recently fallen in love and I'm pretty much texting/calling all day. Usually lasts me a solid 12-16 hours. under 10 if calling/app hoarding. EMUI - not as bad as most people are saying. I actually enjoy many of the features they've included (some secret ones). -camera/calculator/flashlight from lock screen amazing. -notification bar swipe up and down with fingerprint scanner. amazing - secret apps (hidden from plain sight. AMAZING - others i forgot. PRETTY COOL IF I REMEMBERED WHAT THEY WERE. Screen- Again I'm a business user. Emails, docs, communication tools, money management apps, and barely any media use. This screen is more than pretty for my work phone. Speed- Just barely snappy enough for my daily needs. Battery management tools. Bang for buck - Nothing like a great bang for a buck. Cons- Not media friendly - Low volume so my on phone meetings are hard to hear in anything other than a quiet room Not game friendly - Don't really care, but different strokes for different blokes. 3gb ram - stops being snappy when 10+ applications are open Not for the flagship user - yeah, if you need the latest and greatest, go spend a grand on a phone. auto lighting isn't very good - i generally keep it low until I'm in a sunny area anyways, but this could matter to some people. no dual band wifi - pretty much my only REAL grip with phone. As a tmobile user wifi service is life. because Tmobile has no service anywhere but metropolitan areas. For a simple user this is great. Maybe the extra gb of ram would have helped, but it's too late now. great phone for basic needs. This phone has me in its clutch.",

                "review_text": "This will be the most honest review of this phone on here. I never write reviews for any products that I purchase, but if I can keep ONE person from wasting their money on this jalopy of a phone, this time will be well spent. I switched to this phone from a Samsung Galaxy J3 (the bottom of the barrel $60 GoPhone). That phone was by no means a powerhouse, nor did I expect it to be at that price point, but it got basic tasks done well enough. So, when I dropped $180 on the Honor 6x, I expected a substantial upgrade in performance. BOY, WAS I WRONG. I researched the heck out of this ohine before I purchased. It came down to the Honor 6x or the Moto G5. Decided on this one because it was about $40 less, I was on a budget, and the tech/features were pretty close. 1. The camera is this phones main selling point. With its dual-lens, multi-setting camera, and other bullsh*t, this is supposed to be a top-notch camera (FALSE) The camera freezes every time you try to open it, and IF you can get it to open, it takes a solid 10-15 seconds to focus- which by that time whatever candid moment you were trying to capture has long passed. Not to mention, the quality is terrible, although I will say the front facing camera isnt half bad (if youcan get it to open) 2. Performance wise, its a joke. Apps constantly crash when you run them, browser freezes, etc. Its makes social media apps a nightmare that st I really just gave up on. 3. Only saving grace (hence the 2 stars), is battery life. The hr battery lasts forever, even as your closing apps and trying to restart it to get something done. I really wanted to like this phone, but I seriously regret buying. Will be replacing with a higher quality brand in the very near future. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. -an angry consumer",

No complaints about the camera either. My only negative is the display. As a few other's have said here, the \"vibrancy\" of the color seems rather poor. Compared to other phones I've owned, certain colors don't quite look right. Red is probably the worst: It actually looks halfway between red and black. Best I can describe the look is \"washed out\". Even some low end phones I've had recently have a better display. At first it really annoyed me, but truthfully, I've gotten used to it, and it certainly isn't terrible. There is a color temperature adjustment in settings, but I've messed with that a lot...it doesn't really help. I don't regret the purchase, given the very reasonable price, and that everything else is fantastic. Edit: Have had the phone for 4 months and still working fine. I am adding the fact that it doesn't connect to 5 Ghz WiFi. That's a little disappointing, but connecting to 2.4 is no problem at all. I'm still glad I bought it. BTW, I've gotten used to the colors. I don't even notice it anymore.",

To have a new phone that begins to malfunction after 10 days of use make me feel that I got ripped out. Initially, I thought the screen was freezing because I wasn't connected to the internet, however that shouldn't mean other apps freeze, too.

On a very heavy use day of gaming and live video streams I was able to get at least 10 hours without having to return to the charger and on a average to moderate day I have gone a full day without recharging.

THE best camera, killer battery, clean Android interface. Best under $200 phone, hands down. If I could afford the next model up, I'd jump on it. But totally and perfectly happy with this.",

Not a big deal, I'll just switch cards out when necessary but still.... I'm not entirely sure why this was changed. Besides this, the 6X is just better.... Faster, better screen, better camera, etc. It's more rounded than the 5X which is largely irrelevant considering it's in a case. For $249 it's a great value.",

Later on the first day I got the phone I noticed the screen would glitch or skip back and forth when scrolling every now and then. It's done it everyday since and tends to happen more when temperature drops. I also believe the speaker came to me as a dud. It's crackly and has to be the worst smartphone speaker I've ever heard. Called both Honor and Amazon reps several weeks ago to resolve this and neither could resolve my issues without further inconveniencing me. That's why my rating is a 2/5. Aside from my screen doing this annoying glitch 30% of the time and my speaker music being garbage it's a great phone.",

She has an Honor 5X and loves it, so I thought I'd give this a try for myself. Wife uses hers for constant conversations and facebook/youtube. I use mine only for phone/text and to play music from my SD cards, played into my Sennheiser PXC 550 headphones. Both phones work very well indeed for our needs. Though the 6X does drain its battery faster than my old phone (5000 ma/h battery) it is still better than phones I've had previously and it doesn't really affect me since I can charge from anywhere using my battery pack. What IS noticeable, however, is the SPEED of this phone compared to ANY I've had before, the fast octacore CPU and the 3gb RAM do their job very nicely. It does not stall, freeze, hesitate in any way for me. The fingerprint reader unlocks the phone instantly... so fast, in fact that I tried opening it with every fingerprint I have, just to see if they're faking it. Nope, it's for real. I set it for BOTH of my index fingerprints to make it simpler to grab and open with either hand. Cameras: For my purpose, this is far better than expected. My previous phones had \"adequate\" cameras that I'd use if I didn't care about quality (I have a Canon and a Panasonic Lumix G7 for high quality photos and videos)... but this little phone rivals those in its quality once you learn how to use it. The video does not have the stabilization feature that the high priced cellphones have, or my dedicated cameras... so panning slowly is a bit jittery... but nobody notices it but me so far. HOWEVER, my phone had difficulties in setting up. The wife's did not. Then suddenly they decided to update to a better EMUI (the user interface that is Android but looks like an iPhone)... and all of the difficulties ended. We are happy with the phones, but it would have saved me several hours if the full updated EMUI was originally installed.",

I had avoided the budget models because they always felt cheap (light and primarily plastic) and seemed slow & glitchy.... After 3 years my Galaxy was acting up (again), but I was tired of shelling out $650 for a phone every time. So I decided to give the honor a try. I love it. It has the look, feel and weight of flagship lines, the fingerprint technology is actually better than the Galaxy in my opinion, speed is fast and I actually like the generic Android layout better than my Samsung. so far no complaints other than \"I wish I knew about this brand years ago\". Well worth the risk. Excellent phone for the price.",

                "review_text": "I switched to this phone from a Samsung Galaxy Edge S6. This may seem like a massive downgrade for some folks, but I am actually enjoying the Honor 6X more than the Edge S6, which I'll explain below in my comprehensive review. Body/Form-Factor (4/5): The Honor 6X isn't anything really spectacular to look at, but it feels durable and nice in the hand. It's aesthetic is decently pleasing to me. I do not enjoy phones that are trying to be overly flashy or fancy (mainly because I put a case on them anyway). It fits well in the hand and I love that all the buttons are on the right-side. The S6 has the volume buttons on the left-hand side which was annoying for one-handed use. The placement of the fingerprint reader is amazing, I have seen it on the back in other phones, but I think Huawei found the sweet-spot for me. It's in the PERFECT place for my long fingers. Otherwise, the build-quality is solid, it doesn't feel like it would explode on impact if I dropped it. On the other hand, the S6 was nasty-feeling without a case with all the glass and was so thin I feared shattering it. Display (4/5): For a mid-range budget phone the display is very attractive. There is some slight saturation on blacks, and reds seem to POP with intensity. This is especially noticeable using the camera. However, I am fond of black-themed UIs, so I have black on black and it actually looks very nice without too much saturation. You're not going to get the intense color-ranges you will with Samsung's AMOLED screen. The Honor 6X is a standard IPS LCD screen, coming in at 1080x1920 with a ~403 PPI density. Better than other mid-range devices, and you really can't beat that for the price. The screen is crisp and clear, if you're comparing it to a high-range phone, you're going to be disappointed. However, remembering you only paid ~$250 (as of this review) then you'll be pleasantly surprised! I have used the phone in bright light and darkest night, with no issues. Screen is amazing for the price, but there are better screens on higher-end phones (if you want to pay for them, that is). Screen, Physical (2/5): I had to say something about the actual GLASS that comes with the device. It comes with a pre-installed screen protector, it doesn't look like a factory film, it literally looks like a SCREEN PROTECTOR (however it's really not, it's just a cheap plastic thing that doesn't like to come off). If you're buying this phone do yourself a favor and GET A SCREEN PROTECTOR ASAP. I always protect my devices with either a glass or the \"liquid\" screen protectors (the gel-like kind) and this phone absolutely has to have one. I did a screen stress-test and it received several small scratches just by being in my pocket for a day without a protector, something a phone with any kind of tempered glass or gorilla glass would not do. It's not super bad, you're not going to encounter any massive scrapes from daily use if you carry it without anything else in your pocket, but you WILL get a lot of small, annoying scratches. The good news is any glass or gel screen protector will cover those right up! Launcher, Emotion UI (3/5): EMUI get's a pretty bad rap, but it's honestly not THAT bad. My biggest gripe is the lack of an app drawer, it forces everything to the main screen, which can get pretty cluttered even if you're using the folders. Alas, this is not a heavily weighing factor for me, because third-party launchers exist. Other than that it's a fairly standard launcher, it's actually very snappy and fast. If you can get over the no app drawer, then it shouldn't be an issue at all. Speed/Snappiness/Responsiveness (5/5): The Honor 6X is sporting a Kirin 655, 2.1GHz Cortex-A53 (with a Mali-T830MP2 GPU), which is an impressive chip for the price. I did a stress test with YouTube, a 3D game, Facebook, Chrome (with multiple windows), Google Maps, and Google Music all in the background of the device at once and saw only a minimal amount of device lag. Albeit, in reality, I wouldn't have all those things open at once anyway. Standard use sees absolutely no lag and the device is always incredibly responsive. One of the biggest issues I have had with trying out mid-tier budget phones is that after a couple of apps open they DRAGGGGG to almost a halt before closing something. This phone handles it like a bloody champ! External SD Card Slot (5/5): Thought I'd just add this here, most expensive phones these days are sorely lacking this, and I do love to download everything and anything. Especially since I use my device everyday as a music player, so I require a lot of space! You can add a 256 GB SD card for all your HD videos and music on the go! Camera (5/5): This is really where this phone SHINES. All the other mid-tier phones I have tried all have a terribad camera. I mean, it's normally VERY bad. If you're in the market for a budget phone and want a nice camera, look no further. This camera rivals my Edge S6 (which I have touted as the best camera on any smartphone, when it came out). The camera app has a bunch of awesome built-in features and you can tell they spent some time here. The Pro Photo mode really lets you change anything you want to get that AWESOME shot. HDR works as intended. The \"Good Food\" option seems to be some sort of macro setting, accentuating the warm tones. The \"Light Painting\" feature is actually really cool, it mimics and recreates those cool light-shots you can get from moving cars or spelling stuff out with lights! I had great fun with the \"Slo-Mo\" mode, where you can make things slow motion and even edit whatever is slow motion at the end of it. The \"Document Scan\" mode works AMAZINGLY. It will auto-snap and crop any document you're currently trying to take a picture of and then auto-edit it for readability. I used it at work to take a lazy-screencap of a document on my computer monitor and it worked GREAT! The secondary camera is actually very, very nice. Coming in at 8MP, and an auto-beauty mode for those flawless selfies! It has all the same features as the standard camera so they didn't skimp on all the features just because it's a secondary. I'd also like to add that Huawei integrated a classic Gallery instead of incorporating Photos like almost every other phone has done. I really miss the old-school gallery, and I thank Huawei for actually including one instead of me having to pay for a decent one through Google Play. Sound (2/5): The headset speaker is decent, you can definitely hear people. They're not particularity crisp or mega-clear. You can certainly hear them just fine, the loudness isn't a big issue. The call quality is varying, it might be my service, who knows. The speaker is sorely lacking, it's not loud and at it's max volume it kind of sounds like a muffled room noise. It's not AMAZINGLY bad, but if you're an audiophile looking for a decent speaker, this is not the budget phone for you (I don't think audiophile and budget should be used in the same sentence). It gets the job done, I usually carry headphones or a bluetooth speaker with my anyway so this didn't shy me away from the phone at all, so I don't weight very heavily on this part. Ports/Comms (3/5): The ONLY reason I'm giving this a 3/5 is because it lacks 5 GHz Wi-fi. Something that seemingly every other mid-tier phone has incorporated, Huawei decided to just not on the Honor 6X. This is a bit annoying to me because I was seriously spoiled on my 5 GHz wi-fi at my house. No NFC, so if you're looking to use Android Pay, you'll probably have to sync a smartwatch to the phone! Other than that, there's v4.1 bluetooth chip with all the trimmings, it works flawlessly and amazingly. It doesn't seem to use any power at all! MicroUSB. Really Huawei? C'mon you could of scored a 5/5 with me with USB-C and 5 GHz wi-fi! With almost every other phone moving over now to USB-C (sans Samsung) it would seem natural that Hauwei would do this. They're already using it on all their other flagship phones. I guess it was to save on the price, which I can totally get. However I really, really love USB-C. Fingerprint Reader (5/5): Thought I'd throw this in here because most fingerprint readers are just awful. Not in terms of functionality, but in positioning. The reader on the Honor 6X is AMAZINGLY places for actual use. The S6 Edge has it on the front of the phone which is useless for me, because I normally place my phone face-down or it's in my pocket with the screen toward me. The response time on the reader is insane! One micro-second tap and BAM you're in. At first I thought it was fake, so I had several buddies try it and NOPE! Wouldn't let them in. Way to put an awesome reader that definitely rivals the high-end phones Huawei! Battery (5/5): Wow, my S6 Edge had a terrible battery life if you compare it to the Honor 6X. I use data, bluetooth, wi-fi and max screen brightness everyday. I'm a Reddit and YouTube lover so I'm constantly on those throughout the day. With all that on, using a Reddit app probably ~20 times a day and watching about ~30 minutes of YouTube everyday I still get home after a 12 hour work-day with about 40% battery left. With my S6 I ALWAYS had to plug it in mid-day because it would be at 10% at 3 PM. With the Honor 6X I just plug it in once a night and leave it there. On my days off I don't even have to charge it at night, it's normally sitting at about 80% without heavy use. There's also a \"Phone Optimizer\" built in that helps extend battery life. It will even tell you how much battery life it might save if you turn off X feature. Overall (5/5): Despite the small downsides, the Honor 6X comes in swinging at a $250 price point. If you're looking for a feature-packed phone that has an awesome camera and amazing battery life, LOOK NO FURTHER! I am currently using this device as my main device. I have NEVER used a mid-tier budget phone as a main device, but this one really bit me! Great job Huawei, the Honor 6X is awesome!",

                "review_text": "Pros: Fingerprint scanner works great, fast processor, lots of memory, long battery life and fast charging (if you use the huawei charger) Cons: A bit bigger than I expected (my fault though, the size is listed on in the description) I've had this phone for a little over 3 months and I freakin love it. I'm not a super tech savvy user. I just wanted something cheap that compared well to the previous gen Samsung Galaxy and iPhone. First of all the fingerprint scanner. This is my first phone with a fingerprint scanner. When I ordered this phone I didn't really think much about this feature. Now that I have it I can't imagine going back to a phone that doesn't have one. It makes unlocking the phone so effortless. Also putting the fingerprint on the back of the phone, just below the camera lenses, was a brilliantly elegant engineering idea. Seriously, I've showed this to my friends with iPhones and they've all said they wish Apple had put the finger scanner on the back too. Basically the difference is I can pick up my phone and unlock it in one motion, because all I have to do is place either my right or left index finger on the scanner. I'm cradling the phone in my hand anyway, it's so easy to just press my finger against the scanner in the fraction of a second it takes me to pick up my phone. Some people have complained about the UI. It's not that bad, or wasn't anyway. Huawei just rolled out a new UI with a new update. The new one is ok. It's very similar to Samsung's. I didn't mind the old one, and I don't mind the new one either. My only complaint is that the phone is bigger than my old Samsung Galaxy, but that's on me for not paying attention to the size in the description. I wish it were a bit smaller, but honestly I've grown to live with the size. It's not ridiculously big, but it's big. At this point it's just something I tolerate because I love everything else about the phone. The camera is pretty good, but not great. Not as good as my Dad's Galaxy 8, but then again that phone is a lot more expensive. I don't care that much about camera quality anyway.",

                "review_text": "UPDATE 4/15/18 - After finally receiving my Oreo update from Sprint, I can say all the problems I had been having with this phone (dropped calls, freezing 3-4 times per day, etc) are all fixed. Now this phone is, at last, a fantastic device agian. Essential has been quick and consistent with the updates. However, I highly suggest you buy it unlocked so you don't have to deal with the frustration of carrier delays to updates. First off\u2014the tech site reviews for this phone range from lukewarm to horrible, which almost caused me to do an immediate exchange without even opening the box, but I decided to give the Essential phone a shot for a day or two. I am glad I did because I can honestly see no reason why this phone has received the kinds of reviews that have littered the online tech websites. The Essential PH-1 is an elegant, powerful, and smooth-working device that is as well designed, physically, as any phone I have ever held in my hands. Now that its price has been cut down to $499, it's a complete no-brainer. Hardware Simply put, the Essential phone is an eye-catcher. The ceramic back is clean and beautiful, though it does attract fingerprints like crazy\u2014of course, which phone doesn't, these days? The titanium frame offers a high-end feel to it, and the front screen is made of Gorilla Glass 5. It is a heavy, substantial phone, given its relative size. Essential claims it needs no protective case, and indeed if you look for one, you are hard-pressed to find a case anywhere. Amazon pretty much only offers skins, which is somewhat frightening to consider. However, the ceramic back is comfortable to hold onto, though it does tend to slide off surfaces if they\u2019re not flat. It comes with a speaker on the bottom side that is just OK. You will not be listening to music through this speaker unless you have no other choice. That is a non-issue for me, but it is something you might consider. Also, going with what seems to be a trend in smartphones, the Essential phone does not have a headphone jack, though it does come with an adapter dongle which fits into the USB-C port. Personally, I almost never use headphones, so it\u2019s another non-issue for me. There is a powerful Snapdragon 835 processor under the hood and 4GB of memory, which is more than enough for just about anyone. There is 128 gig of storage that comes standard...that's right, standard. Given that most phones charge you a lot more for that much storage, it's a great deal--especially at the currently reduced prices. The fingerprint sensor works every time, perfectly, and very quickly. It\u2019s the fastest fingerprint scanner I\u2019ve ever used, and unlike the S8, the sensor sits in a convenient place on the back. The PH-1 is not water-proof. It\u2019s rated only to withstand a light sprinkle or splash, and that\u2019s about it. Screen The screen is not OLED, which is something that has stirred up some controversy, at least among reviewers and phone junkies. However, Essential\u2019s LCD screen is crisp and quite bright\u2014it renders colors beautifully. Comparing it to the Galaxy S8, side by side, the difference was not as stark as one might believe. Colors pop and blacks are particularly rich for a non-OLED screen. The bezel-less design looks gorgeous, and the little camera notch at the top seems to disappear almost immediately. No, this screen is not as flashy as the one on the Galaxy S8, but it\u2019s not too far behind. I find Essential\u2019s screen is not as saturated as Samsung\u2019s and is much easier on the eyes for long periods of viewing. Battery So far, the battery pretty much lasts the day. I usually have to charge when I get home in the evening, which is disappointing but typical of every phone I've used. The phone also comes with a fast charging and a USB-c cable with a high end braided design. It charges up really fast. Software The Essential PH-1 comes loaded with stock Android and almost nothing else. This lack of bloatware is refreshing, especially after using Samsung\u2019s software. The phone zips along, and I have so far encountered no glitches or stutters at all. Recent updates have cleared up some glitches and shutdowns that were plaguing the phone\u2019s early release. Now, it\u2019s smooth and consistent with an experience much like what you would find with iOS. In fact, iPhone users thinking of switching to Android might want to consider the Essential, as it would be an easier transition than having to figure out a whole lot of bloatware. Unlike most other Android phones, Essential doesn\u2019t have any of the redundancies that cause so many switchers to run back to Apple\u2014no double notifications for two different email clients or three separate weather apps. It\u2019s basically like a Pixel phone, but with a better screen and more impressive physical design. Camera Here is where the controversy with this phone actually lies, and where I feel the need to clear up a whole lot of misconceptions. Many phone reviewers have trashed the camera, probably because they were using a version that Essential should never have sent out. Just remember that when you\u2019re reading those reviews, most of them were written in July or August, which is light years away from where this phone currently sits. In short, this phone\u2019s camera is good in its current state. I see very little difference between photos taken with this camera and the iPhone 7 Plus I used this past year. It\u2019s true there had been some software issues with the onboard camera app, but they seem to have been fixed over the course of several recent updates. This camera produces true colors that sometimes can still be slightly dark in less than ideal lighting conditions. However, I tried a side by side test with a Galaxy S8+, and I found each camera had strengths and weaknesses when it came to shooting in low light. The Galaxy tended to overexpose the photo, washing out the colors, or oversaturating the shot. The Essential tended to replicate a truer version of the room, which meant some parts were slightly dark, but the subject was closer to its actual color. The Essential camera operates with one color camera and one black and white camera, using software to combine the two images to provide truer colors and more clarity. When it first shipped (especially the versions sent to tech reviewers), the software was a mess, causing the camera to lag, shut down, freeze, and take horrible shots, especially in low lighting. However, these deficiencies were not caused by the cameras themselves, but the software. That\u2019s a good thing because software can be sorted out and fixed, which is what Essential has done\u2014and what they continue to do. In fact, a significant software update came just two nights ago, fixing the speed with which the app combines the color and black and white images. By the way, I've been having A LOT of fun using the mono-mode black and white camera. It takes some of the sharpest images I've ever taken on a phone camera. So, what\u2019s the verdict on this supposedly terrible camera? After the recent updates, it\u2019s a good camera with the potential to be great, if Essential continues to make incremental adjustments, which they do seem to be committed to. Conclusion Are there drawbacks? Sure! There are drawbacks to virtually any phone you buy. The lack of waterproofing and no headphone jack might turn some people away, understandably. Also, the fact that you cannot buy a protective case for this phone is highly worrisome. I am not sure I trust them when they say the titanium is so strong it does not need a case. One drop straight to that Gorilla Glass and\u2026 However, the strengths of the Essential phone far outweigh those drawbacks, at least for me, and the PH-1 should at least warrant more consideration than it\u2019s gotten from the tech media. If you\u2019ve lusted after this phone, please don\u2019t be frightened away by the bad publicity. Give it a shot and I think you will be pleasantly surprised. UPDATE 12/4/17 After two months of use, I still think this is a very good phone with smooth, fast, reliable performance. The recent updates have been great. Essential continues to release consistent updates, especially to the camera app which has had some amazing improvements lately--including a portrait mode that rivals that on the iPhone and Pixel. And I have to say, as a fan of black and white photography, the mono mode camera is one of my favorite things ever. There has been one hiccup--once in a while it freezes and I have to do a hard reset. It's not a big deal and hasn't happened too often, and thankfully the phone powers up fast, but I do hope they sort this issue out soon. Sprint has been very slow to release the latest build, so perhaps it will be handled in that update. Plus, Oreo looks to be coming in the relatively near future! UPDATE 11/4/17 - After a month of use, I can comfortably say this is a fantastic device and Essential continues to support it with bi-monthly updates. The latest update fixed some touch issues that some people were having (I didn't) and introduced a few gestures to the fingerprint sensor, like those on the Pixel phone. There is now a case available on Amazon...I bought it and it's not too bad. Personally, I like going without the case because the phone is really easy to grip. I've heard that soon Essential will be adding a \"portrait mode\" to the camera app, which is exciting, and of course, Oreo is supposed to be on its way before long too. I have been using the camera a lot and I feel they are getting close to just right under low light conditions. In normal lighting, there's no problem at all. And the mono mode black and white camera takes some of the best photos I have ever taken on a phone. The verdict remains the same...only with some increased vehemence. If you're a fan of stock android, fast smooth performance, and beautifully designed devices, there shouldn't be much of a debate. Buy this phone!",

Press reviews got me intrigued enough to give it a try (after checking the return policy). I have now been using the Essential Phone as my primary device for 3 days and I LOVE IT. I\u2019ll update this review as things progress. Other reviews are doing a great job going into many aspects so I\u2019ll just add my perspective as a user (see the kind of user I am at the bottom). DESIGN is a WINNER ( + ) Beautiful (look at it) ( + ) Simple/ergonomic (stock Android + no bloatware) ( + ) Different (people ask me about it) yet not quirky It JUST WORKS ( + ) A LOT of screen in a truly one-handed form factor, ( + ) Touch input works great ( + ) Great call quality, ( + ) Fast camera, ( + ) All day battery, ( + ) Fast and accurate fingerprint sensor (I tried many & they aren\u2019t all the same, this one is the real deal) ( + ) \u201cAccidental drop\u201d resilient (accidentally tested already) meaning I don\u2019t need a case (at long last a beautiful phone that doesn\u2019t need a case) The PRICE is RIGHT (~$300 below similarly spec\u2019d premium phones). At $500, it is a great value (but still an expensive phone \u2014 premium materials etc.)! The \u201cflaws\u201d I don\u2019t care much about (I call them SMART TRADE-OFFS) ( + / \u2014 ) Camera/Picture quality (good enough for me), ( + / \u2014 ) Not for VR (still a \u201cniche\u201d use case), ( + / \u2014 ) Not waterproof (I don\u2019t swim with my phone), ( + / \u2014 ) No headphone jack (I love USB-C), ( + / \u2014 ) Weak built-in speaker (I use a headset or an actual high quality speaker when I need good/loud sound), ( + / \u2014 ) Unclear whether front facing camera will enable advanced face recognition use cases (the future is coming but I live in the present) The things I wish it did better (or \u201cWhy not a 5 star rating\u201d) ( \u2014 ) I\u2019d like the screen to be brighter / colors to be more vivid. Those with the current generation of iPhones won\u2019t necessarily mind, but for folks used to premium (AM)OLED phones (e.g. Samsung, Google Pixel, LG, etc.), it might very well be a deal breaker. ( \u2014 ) I\u2019d like the camera app to be better, starting with \u201cmanual\u201d mode (like what Motorola does). I am confident Andy\u2019s team will improve the camera app though, they already have in the past month as per the press. This phone is right for me, but is it right for you? The kind of user I am - I live in the cloud. I love Google services (and Amazon\u2019s too!). I appreciate Apple\u2019s \u201cless is more\u201d design principles and the superb quality and durability of their products, but I don\u2019t like that it is often \u201ctheir way or no way\u201d. - I use my phone a lot, mostly as a work tool (+ videos, and a few games for my kids). - I have 121 apps installed (for those who care to know, I included my home screen with the 30 or so that I use daily). - I am on T-Mobile. - I am \u201ccheap\u201d (or to put it nicely: \u201csavvy\u201d). I don\u2019t like to pay for the brand premium or the fanciness I don\u2019t need. I am fine paying for quality or \u201cfair trade / eco friendliness\u201d, but I have found that \u201chigh quality on the basics\u201d and \u201cinexpensive\u201d actually align * Oct 18 update: 50 days in, I am sticking with the Essential Phone. But I confirm my \"not for everyone\" comment. I think for most people, the Pixel 2 is a better choice (congrats team Google!) * Day 50: new pros and new cons (+) It still looks like new despite my having used it without a case. That is very impressive (I tend to bend my phones, or scratch them, or both)! (+) The charger Andy's team included is AMAZING (it must have been pricey). I can easily charge my laptop with it (USB C) (-) The camera is starting to bother me. I downloaded another camera app... (-) The power button below the volume button seems suboptimal to me (-) That phone is slippery... I haven't found an elegant solution (I really dont want to add a skin or a case, but I'll keep looking (ideas?) Comparison with Pixel 2 If you want stock Android, and a phone that just works, the default choice is Google's Pixel. So I got the Pixel 2 (disclosure: I know and admire the team who built it) *Where PH1 wins* - It has a much bigger screen despite being slightly smaller than the Pixel 2, which means a better browsing experience, more apps on the home screen. You just see more (see the pictures). - PH1 seems more durable to me. Pixel 2's coating looks like a great improvement over last year's metallic paint (that tended to chip off quickly), but I don't think it will beat ceramic and titanium. * Where Pixel 2 wins * - Pixel's camera is AWESOME. Even I became an ok photographer. It is incredibly fast, and the pictures turn out super sharp, with great colors, etc. The movies are amazing as well. - much better speaker (and there are 2 of them) - UI significantly more responsive - Water proof - Squeezable assistant is cute and may create a warm emotional bond... we shall see *One more thing* I now have the 360 degree camera and I must say I really like it",

                "review_text": "I've been using the Essential Phone for close to a month now, and am currently reviewing it after receiving my Pixel 2 phone a few days ago to test both. After playing around with the controversial camera on both devices, I am happy with returning my Pixel 2 in a few days. Make no mistake, the Pixel 2 has a wonderful camera. Even after sideloading the Google Camera app on to the Essential Phone, there were still noticeable differences in the low-light picture quality and the camera speed. I even compared them both with the iPhone X, and the Pixel 2 still arguably came out on top. But aside from that, I can't say that the Pixel 2 has anything else that I don't get with the Essential Phone, personally. Waterproofing is nice, but I've never dropped my phone in any body of water in the 10 years I've been owning a cellphone. Stereo speakers are also nice, but I use them about once a week at highest frequency. Google's timely updates do sound very tempting, but I'm very happy that Essential has just rolled out their Oreo beta a week ago, with the final build coming this year. This leaves the physical build, price, screen and battery life as the determining factors. The build quality and aesthetics of the Essential wins hands-down for me. No contest there. So is the price. I got my Essential for $400 (after taking advantage of Amazon's additional $50 gift card promo). And the Pixel 2 is priced at $740 (after the $115 trade-in credit I'd get with my old Nexus). The $300 difference is quite stark at this point. OLED is nice. Sure. But after using the 5.7in display on the Essential, I don't think I can go back to the meager 5in display found in the Pixel 2. The higher contrast attributed to the OLED panel found in the Pixel 2 is nice, but the difference is barely noticeable. The main beneficiary of this technology would be the lower power usage. Which brings me to the battery. The 3000mah battery found in the Essential should make up for the extra juice required to run the LCD panel. After testing both for the past few days, I can't say if there's a clear winner between the two. The Pixel 2's smaller battery can be compensated by the better software optimization by Google to ensure one full day of use. Essential might still have a few kinks to iron out with their software to ensure they don't unintentionally drain the battery life through poor software optimization. Both have been giving me full-day use with more than enough to spare (25%-50% left in the tank on a good day). In the end, I feel like the Essential is a better match for me. Your opinion and needs might differ, but I hope this review gave you some additional peace of mind before taking the lunge. Cheers!",

                "review_text": "Oh what to say? Disappointment? I researched this phone a lot. I work in tech. It came down to this or the pixel 2. I prefer small phones and not phablets. I chose essential because it's different, it's a small form factor, the large screen real estate relative to size of phone, and flagship specs. The recent discount was the tipping point. Go with the essential, right? Who cares it doesn't have an sd card slot, an aux input for audio, or amoled display. This actually looks very good in the sun. Fact it's LCD is ok. So why 3 stars? Bugs...freaking bugs! How else do you explain after four days of use pretty consistent freezing and lack of touch recognition with very light use? My phone has updated twice since it arrived from amazon last Saturday, Oct. 28. Nothing has improved. I was texting today...texting..and my phone froze for a good 3 seconds while I tried to text a response back. Really? I'm not playing games on this. I'm texting, surfing the web, using gps, pretty much \"essential\" stuff, right? Imagine this phone in a year, or two years, with these issues. I visited the android forums to find out why. Turns out these are hit and miss issues and certainly they exist for many buyers. I'm giving this a week before sending it back and buying a pixel 2. I like underdogs. I support start ups. This phone, though, needs to be fixed soon or I'm sending it back. Even at 500...I can't recall the last time I,spent this much and has similar issues. Essential, fix this phone! I want to support you.",

                "review_text": "DISCLAIMER: This is purely my experience, your opinion and experience will vary, naturally. With most of my smartphone experience being on Android, I was letdown to say the least with all the typical inconsistencies and experiences I had over the years. The last year or so I was using an iPhone and pretty much got used to iOS and incorporating the features and nuances to my workflow day in and day out but missed the freedom of Android dearly. Being an avid Android enthusiast and devouring any bit of Essential phone news I can find since it was initially announced, it was hard to resist at least trying it before committing to the iPhone further with the recent iPhone 8 Plus. Going into the Sprint store and seeing the Essential phone their and having some quick hands-on time with it, I was immediately impressed with the hand-in feel. Having read countless reviews with so much high praise going to the build quality, I was in complete agreement after my time with it. The thought of such a high end Android phone and with the backing of Andy Rubin as the project's leader, it was very hard to pass up and I am so glad I didn't pass on it. It was definitely an Ahhh moment when I opened to box, I probably put too much emphasis on presentation but I am so glad I'm not the only one that obsesses over small details. The unboxing tells you that this is a special device and Essential took extra care in making sure you know that they thought so too. The build quality is unlike any other phone I've held and I have about a dozen high end phones from every smartphone era dating back to 2007 and smartphone platform. Also details like the beautiful braided USB-C charging cable with metal end caps and the metal 27W charging brick, you rarely if ever see such attention being paid to the included accessories. Build quality, presentation aside, focusing on the phone and how it is to use. For me for the most part, it is a joy to use. Running as pure Android as you will find (Pixel isn't pure AOSP Android anymore like Nexus was), everything is generally smooth and fast. Having the latest Snapdragon 835 will do that and a 2017 standard for RAM at 4GB is also good enough for most anything you wanna throw at it. Those who have complained about camera quality and camera speed, I will say first off that I am not a heavy camera user on a smartphone, only taking pictures on occasion so the best camera isn't a high requirement for me, if it is to you, you may want to look at the LG V30 or the S8/S8+, Pixel or iPhone. Overall usability to me is far more important and being able to quickly transition between apps/screens is a joy to experience on a device with no bloatware to speak of, just clean Android as Andy Rubin intended with this device. If build quality, up to date Android releases, a fast, fluid UI experience are things you value then you can't go wrong with the Essential.",

                "review_text": "tl;dr 1. This phone is amazing in many ways 2. Most reviews from pre-November were based on at least 3 software updates behind the current version and much has improved. 3. When you get this phone and it asks you to install one update, you are not done: you must go to to settings->about phone->system update and check for another one. You must repeat this process until it tells you that \"Your system is up to date\". If you don't do this then you are likely still on old, buggier versions of the software. I'm guessing that some of the recent reviewers here have not done this. My moto x pure had been a great phone, but I needed to replace it for two reasons: the battery was never great and getting worse as it aged, and I was getting tired of carrying this giant thing in my pocket. If not for those things I would have hung on to it. What I wanted in a new phone: everything that was great about the moto x pure: runs Android; great looking, large, and very bright screen; great audio from the front facing stereo speakers; great camera; no bloatware; a quick way to launch the camera which was the same whether locked or unlocked; fast and smooth; durable and scratch-resistant; a headphone jack. To that list I added some things that the moto was not good at or never had: long battery life, being small enough to use one-handed and not be bursting out of my pocket, and a fast, accurate fingerprint reader. I looked at and rejected lots of phones, none of them had everything I wanted. Does the essential phone have everything I wanted? No way, but it's better than the rest for me for the following reasons. Pros ------ * Screen: A large, beautiful, responsive screen in the smallest size. When you pull this phone out of your pocket, hold it in your hand, reach across the screen with one hand, and look at the great screen, you'll probably get what I'm saying. * Speed: Very fast and smooth operation. No stuttering or other slowdowns. Runs the fastest Android processor currently available, same as on the S8 and others costing much more. * Camera launch: Can launch the camera quickly and easily, the same way, regardless of whether it's locked, screen off, or I'm using it. * Speaker: Very loud and clear *Battery: amazing battery life, looks like it will allow for 2-3x the screen on time of the moto x which ranged from 2 to 3 hours. * Bloatware: Android on the Essential is even more pure than that of my moto x pure edition * Fingerprint sensor: this one is very fast and accurate, it's great to have one finally. The one small problem is that it's not recessed very far into the body, so it can be slightly tricky to find sometimes. But it's so fast and accurate that usually getting in the vicinity of the center works for me. * Ambient light sensor: works perfectly, always at a good level for me no matter where I am. * GPS: perfect * Updates: Supported by a small, hungry startup which cares so much about the success of their product that they will push out multiple updates in a month. The larger companies and the carriers don't seem to care that much. Oreo should be coming soon, and unlike with other companies, I believe it. * Security: 3 years promised monthly security updates (My moto x pure went for almost a year without a security update, and I don't think that's unusual). * Storage: Huge amount of storage, 128GB * Price: And, perhaps best of all, the price. I was lucky enough to get this phone at what was probably the lowest price it will ever see, less than half the price of a similarly equipped pixel 2 XL or Galaxy S8 plus. The price has already gone up a bit, I recommend that you get it before it goes higher. OK ----- * Speaker: I was hoping to get front facing speakers like I had in the moto, but those days are over, I think, and it's well worth losing that for the small size. Despite the lack of front facing speakers, the single downward facing speaker on this phone is louder than the moto and seems just as clear. But you can cover it somewhat easily with your hand, as in any other phone with this type of speaker. * Camera: You've probably heard many complaints about the camera. Some of them have likely been addressed by recent updates, but there are still some issues. I haven't tested it extensively yet, but so far it seems to be not quite as good as the moto x pure. The pure camera has been fantastic for me, so a small downgrade is not a big deal for me. And I'm hoping it will get better with updates. I have not yet tried the ripped Google camera apk that others have had success with. * USB-C: had to happen sooner or later, but I'm not happy about having to buy more cables and chargers, and not being able to use the same on the other devices in my house Cons ------- * Headphone jack: I'm just gonna have to get used to not having one. Not ideal, but it was getting to be a pain to plug in every time I got in the car; I bought a bluetooth car receiver along with the phone. * Water resistance: I was looking forward to having a phone that I could use without fear in the water, but this phone is not it. * Flashlight: I really liked the chop gesture to turn on the moto flashlight. I used that all the time when I needed quick light and didn't want to have to unlock my phone, pull down the notifications, and tap on the flashlight. Every phone should have something like this.",

                "review_text": "I've been using this phone for ~2 months with daily use ranging from extensive to moderate. The decision to purchase this phone came with much trepidation - reviews in 20017 were sour on the phones camera, lag, screen jitters, and cost. However, the patches and new software releases were generating positive momentum for the phone. The price drop was the final motivation to purchase this phone as a replacement for my Nexus 6. After 2 months of solid use, I have absolutely no complaints - in fact, I love this phone. I'm a big fan of an unmolested Android UI and this has exactly what I'm looking for. As a former owner of all of the larger device manufacturers (Motorola, LG, HTC, Apple, etc.), the customized OEM \"skin\" have yielded little benefit other than expedited battery drain. Essential staying with a stock Android UI allows the PH-1 to operate very fast, hold a charge for almost 2 days with moderate use, and supports honest multi-tasking. Like you, the camera feedback was a big concern for me. The camera reviews received little love, and from what I read, this was deserved. However, when I received the phone, 3 updates were immediately available so the low light issues and slow shutter speed challenges never appeared. In fact, last night I received another camera update. The new portrait feature has been put through the paces on the phone and is a great feature with solid results. At this point, I'd stack the camera on this phone up to almost any phone with the possible exception of Samsung and Pixel. So think about it, there are dozens of other phone manufactures that produce similar if not inferior photo quality to the Essential PH-1. Using the last 6 months as a barometer, the velocity of updates for the camera that we have seen will certain further enhancement photo quality and eliminate all of the concerns for the point and shoot recreational photographer. The bezel-less screen, color contrast, and sharpness are on par with my Apple iPhone. When comparing the screen size to the Apple 8 Plus, the Essential PH-1 has a larger overall useful screen size (eliminating the dead black space around the iPhones's screen). The benefit is a mini-phablet display without the bulk and size of a large phone that I would struggle to put in my pant pocket or mount to a dashboard phone holder. I haven't bench marked the performance of this phone against others as others have done this and you can find the objective data on various Android sites. The objective data speaks very positively for this phone. Historically, I have found that the 2 or 3 month mark is the best time to look back at a phone and determine if the right phone was purchased. Did it perform to my expectations, are there shortfalls that amplified themselves, would I buy this phone again, etc.? In all cases, I'm very pleased with the phone. The areas where I had low expectations, the phone has proven to shine and the concerns weren't manifested. The only features/attributes I wish this phone had were waterproofing and wireless charging. I've grown accustomed to the missing headphone jack but would really like to see the other items addressed in the next iteration of this phone. Based on my demand for a phone and daily usage demand, I would highly recommend this phone. To date, it is the best phone I've owned.",

                "review_text": "Migrated to the PH-1 as a former Samsung flagship owner (most recently the S6 Edge), preceded by a Nexus and a Motorola. People close to me have owned iPhones and Samsungs, which I've played around with frequently, so I've had a good sampling of the flagship products for the past several years. I'll say that, unequivocally, the Essential PH-1 is the best-designed phone I've ever owned, by a wide margin. As noted by many others, its industrial design and overall 'feel' is second-to-none. This thing is an absolute joy to use. Once in a blue moon I'm lucky enough to buy something that delights me every time I use it, see it, or pick it up; the PH-1 is exactly such a thing. I read widely about the phone before purchasing it, and the negative reviews made me sufficiently leery to cancel my pre-order. I then took the plunge in a moment of weakness, and I'm extremely glad I did. I won't spend too much time on this review, but I will say that I think the press the PH-1 has gotten has been grossly unfair (and, honestly, almost conspicuously brutal). As press has an outsized influence on customers' initial impressions of a product, I really don't think this outstanding phone has gotten anything close to a fair shake. I also worry about the negative press's potential to take down what has established itself as a company focused on quality and innovation. Problems? You'll read everywhere that the camera needs some work. Yes, it does. My only real complaints have been on zoomed-in photos, which can look very grainy/pixelated. Anything else is on par with the photos from my S6 Edge, though, whose quality I don't recall being universally condemned. Also, as you'll read elsewhere, the monochrome camera is brilliant; the black & whites are deep & contrasty, and really quite beautiful. Lag/stutter? I haven't seen any whatsoever. Must've been addressed in an update. Reception? Every bit as good as my S6 Edge (and note that Cricket Wireless is my carrier). I honestly have absolutely no idea why this phone isn't being considered as a contender for greatest of 2017. It's easily the best purchase I've made all year, and easily the best phone I've ever owned.",

                "review_text": "Beautiful phone (actually stunning) at a great price. Great for my needs. It's a work of art and I'm a guy who thinks of phones as utilitarian and often disposable tools. Too bad the 360 camera bundle was out of stock when I bought this or would have added it on for 50 bucks. Had trouble deciding between buying the Pixel 2 XL and this phone to replace my venerable Nexus 6P. Last year's Pixels didn't impress me. My decision making process may be different from yours. My check boxes: Need an option other than Oreo for now since a couple of my must-have apps don't work on Oreo. Big high res screen for my older eyes and big fingers. No headphone jack is not a deal-breaker. Smaller pocket size phone is better as long as the screen is big enough. Good battery life. Hate bloatware. Biggish storage. Camera needs to be decently good for reliable use in social settings. I only need photos at a quality/resolution consistent with unlimited Google photo storage. If I need a Nikon, will bring it instead. I have owned all the iphones up to 8, all the Nexus phones, and Samsungs through the 6 model year. I've played with the latest iOS offerings. This thing is very pretty and appears durable with its ceramic back, titanium sides, and gorilla front - but I bought a case anyway. The white does not show fingerprints on the ceramic like the black does. It just feels right. It's the same feeling I got with the iphone 4 at the time - if you can remember that far back. That was so much different than the other stuff on the market. I don't mourn the lack of a SD card because it comes with 128 GB standard. Doesn't feel gimmicky or bloated. Solid is the best way to describe the feel. I can't believe that the 6P and this thing have about the same size screen and this phone's body is so much smaller due to the tiny bezels. The camera notch at the top of the screen doesn't cause any trouble with the apps I use. No back camera hump. I think the non-amoled screen is stunning (at 1312 x 2560). No bloat. Only non-stock app is the camera app. Multiple camera software updates after it got initial poor camera reviews on first release. The updates make the camera much better. You can also load a patched version of the Google pixel camera app. I'm used to that so mostly using the Google port now. You can read about it on xda-developers.com. I've found both are more than fine for taking photos that I would enjoy by looking at them on a screen instead of in print. I think it takes better pics than my old 6P or old iphone 6 Plus when I compare. I think the new iphone and the new pixel do a bit better - but from my perspective, not $400-$600 bucks better. If you make your living with cell phone pics then spend double. NFC reader is on the bottom where the only real bezel is. Speaker is good. Hole for mic is very near the hole for the sim so put your pin in the correct one when installing sim. I ran it on the T-mobile and Verizon network without problem. There is a new T-mobile phone comparability app and it lists this phone as compatible with all their advanced features. No lags or crashes or app problems in a week of use. It did three updates since I had it including the latest security patches. This is my new daily driver. No pocket problems - did I mention big screen in a physically small phone. Battery duration is quite good. Don't miss the headphone jack yet. Might just go buy another one when the 360 camera comes back into stock. Hope this company keeps building nice things.",

                "review_text": "UPDATE 4/15/18 - After finally receiving my Oreo update from Sprint, I can say all the problems I had been having with this phone (dropped calls, freezing 3-4 times per day, etc) are all fixed. Now this phone is, at last, a fantastic device agian. Essential has been quick and consistent with the updates. However, I highly suggest you buy it unlocked so you don't have to deal with the frustration of carrier delays to updates. First off\u2014the tech site reviews for this phone range from lukewarm to horrible, which almost caused me to do an immediate exchange without even opening the box, but I decided to give the Essential phone a shot for a day or two. I am glad I did because I can honestly see no reason why this phone has received the kinds of reviews that have littered the online tech websites. The Essential PH-1 is an elegant, powerful, and smooth-working device that is as well designed, physically, as any phone I have ever held in my hands. Now that its price has been cut down to $499, it's a complete no-brainer. Hardware Simply put, the Essential phone is an eye-catcher. The ceramic back is clean and beautiful, though it does attract fingerprints like crazy\u2014of course, which phone doesn't, these days? The titanium frame offers a high-end feel to it, and the front screen is made of Gorilla Glass 5. It is a heavy, substantial phone, given its relative size. Essential claims it needs no protective case, and indeed if you look for one, you are hard-pressed to find a case anywhere. Amazon pretty much only offers skins, which is somewhat frightening to consider. However, the ceramic back is comfortable to hold onto, though it does tend to slide off surfaces if they\u2019re not flat. It comes with a speaker on the bottom side that is just OK. You will not be listening to music through this speaker unless you have no other choice. That is a non-issue for me, but it is something you might consider. Also, going with what seems to be a trend in smartphones, the Essential phone does not have a headphone jack, though it does come with an adapter dongle which fits into the USB-C port. Personally, I almost never use headphones, so it\u2019s another non-issue for me. There is a powerful Snapdragon 835 processor under the hood and 4GB of memory, which is more than enough for just about anyone. There is 128 gig of storage that comes standard...that's right, standard. Given that most phones charge you a lot more for that much storage, it's a great deal--especially at the currently reduced prices. The fingerprint sensor works every time, perfectly, and very quickly. It\u2019s the fastest fingerprint scanner I\u2019ve ever used, and unlike the S8, the sensor sits in a convenient place on the back. The PH-1 is not water-proof. It\u2019s rated only to withstand a light sprinkle or splash, and that\u2019s about it. Screen The screen is not OLED, which is something that has stirred up some controversy, at least among reviewers and phone junkies. However, Essential\u2019s LCD screen is crisp and quite bright\u2014it renders colors beautifully. Comparing it to the Galaxy S8, side by side, the difference was not as stark as one might believe. Colors pop and blacks are particularly rich for a non-OLED screen. The bezel-less design looks gorgeous, and the little camera notch at the top seems to disappear almost immediately. No, this screen is not as flashy as the one on the Galaxy S8, but it\u2019s not too far behind. I find Essential\u2019s screen is not as saturated as Samsung\u2019s and is much easier on the eyes for long periods of viewing. Battery So far, the battery pretty much lasts the day. I usually have to charge when I get home in the evening, which is disappointing but typical of every phone I've used. The phone also comes with a fast charging and a USB-c cable with a high end braided design. It charges up really fast. Software The Essential PH-1 comes loaded with stock Android and almost nothing else. This lack of bloatware is refreshing, especially after using Samsung\u2019s software. The phone zips along, and I have so far encountered no glitches or stutters at all. Recent updates have cleared up some glitches and shutdowns that were plaguing the phone\u2019s early release. Now, it\u2019s smooth and consistent with an experience much like what you would find with iOS. In fact, iPhone users thinking of switching to Android might want to consider the Essential, as it would be an easier transition than having to figure out a whole lot of bloatware. Unlike most other Android phones, Essential doesn\u2019t have any of the redundancies that cause so many switchers to run back to Apple\u2014no double notifications for two different email clients or three separate weather apps. It\u2019s basically like a Pixel phone, but with a better screen and more impressive physical design. Camera Here is where the controversy with this phone actually lies, and where I feel the need to clear up a whole lot of misconceptions. Many phone reviewers have trashed the camera, probably because they were using a version that Essential should never have sent out. Just remember that when you\u2019re reading those reviews, most of them were written in July or August, which is light years away from where this phone currently sits. In short, this phone\u2019s camera is good in its current state. I see very little difference between photos taken with this camera and the iPhone 7 Plus I used this past year. It\u2019s true there had been some software issues with the onboard camera app, but they seem to have been fixed over the course of several recent updates. This camera produces true colors that sometimes can still be slightly dark in less than ideal lighting conditions. However, I tried a side by side test with a Galaxy S8+, and I found each camera had strengths and weaknesses when it came to shooting in low light. The Galaxy tended to overexpose the photo, washing out the colors, or oversaturating the shot. The Essential tended to replicate a truer version of the room, which meant some parts were slightly dark, but the subject was closer to its actual color. The Essential camera operates with one color camera and one black and white camera, using software to combine the two images to provide truer colors and more clarity. When it first shipped (especially the versions sent to tech reviewers), the software was a mess, causing the camera to lag, shut down, freeze, and take horrible shots, especially in low lighting. However, these deficiencies were not caused by the cameras themselves, but the software. That\u2019s a good thing because software can be sorted out and fixed, which is what Essential has done\u2014and what they continue to do. In fact, a significant software update came just two nights ago, fixing the speed with which the app combines the color and black and white images. By the way, I've been having A LOT of fun using the mono-mode black and white camera. It takes some of the sharpest images I've ever taken on a phone camera. So, what\u2019s the verdict on this supposedly terrible camera? After the recent updates, it\u2019s a good camera with the potential to be great, if Essential continues to make incremental adjustments, which they do seem to be committed to. Conclusion Are there drawbacks? Sure! There are drawbacks to virtually any phone you buy. The lack of waterproofing and no headphone jack might turn some people away, understandably. Also, the fact that you cannot buy a protective case for this phone is highly worrisome. I am not sure I trust them when they say the titanium is so strong it does not need a case. One drop straight to that Gorilla Glass and\u2026 However, the strengths of the Essential phone far outweigh those drawbacks, at least for me, and the PH-1 should at least warrant more consideration than it\u2019s gotten from the tech media. If you\u2019ve lusted after this phone, please don\u2019t be frightened away by the bad publicity. Give it a shot and I think you will be pleasantly surprised. UPDATE 12/4/17 After two months of use, I still think this is a very good phone with smooth, fast, reliable performance. The recent updates have been great. Essential continues to release consistent updates, especially to the camera app which has had some amazing improvements lately--including a portrait mode that rivals that on the iPhone and Pixel. And I have to say, as a fan of black and white photography, the mono mode camera is one of my favorite things ever. There has been one hiccup--once in a while it freezes and I have to do a hard reset. It's not a big deal and hasn't happened too often, and thankfully the phone powers up fast, but I do hope they sort this issue out soon. Sprint has been very slow to release the latest build, so perhaps it will be handled in that update. Plus, Oreo looks to be coming in the relatively near future! UPDATE 11/4/17 - After a month of use, I can comfortably say this is a fantastic device and Essential continues to support it with bi-monthly updates. The latest update fixed some touch issues that some people were having (I didn't) and introduced a few gestures to the fingerprint sensor, like those on the Pixel phone. There is now a case available on Amazon...I bought it and it's not too bad. Personally, I like going without the case because the phone is really easy to grip. I've heard that soon Essential will be adding a \"portrait mode\" to the camera app, which is exciting, and of course, Oreo is supposed to be on its way before long too. I have been using the camera a lot and I feel they are getting close to just right under low light conditions. In normal lighting, there's no problem at all. And the mono mode black and white camera takes some of the best photos I have ever taken on a phone. The verdict remains the same...only with some increased vehemence. If you're a fan of stock android, fast smooth performance, and beautifully designed devices, there shouldn't be much of a debate. Buy this phone!",

                "review_text": "[Nov update: adding one star (4 all in all) given $200 price drop] [See Oct 18 update including Pixel 2 comparison] I was not expecting to love the Essential Phone. \u201cKudos to Essential for what they are trying to achieve, but no way they can compete with the incumbents\u201d \u2026 Or so I thought! Press reviews got me intrigued enough to give it a try (after checking the return policy). I have now been using the Essential Phone as my primary device for 3 days and I LOVE IT. I\u2019ll update this review as things progress. Other reviews are doing a great job going into many aspects so I\u2019ll just add my perspective as a user (see the kind of user I am at the bottom). DESIGN is a WINNER ( + ) Beautiful (look at it) ( + ) Simple/ergonomic (stock Android + no bloatware) ( + ) Different (people ask me about it) yet not quirky It JUST WORKS ( + ) A LOT of screen in a truly one-handed form factor, ( + ) Touch input works great ( + ) Great call quality, ( + ) Fast camera, ( + ) All day battery, ( + ) Fast and accurate fingerprint sensor (I tried many & they aren\u2019t all the same, this one is the real deal) ( + ) \u201cAccidental drop\u201d resilient (accidentally tested already) meaning I don\u2019t need a case (at long last a beautiful phone that doesn\u2019t need a case) The PRICE is RIGHT (~$300 below similarly spec\u2019d premium phones). At $500, it is a great value (but still an expensive phone \u2014 premium materials etc.)! The \u201cflaws\u201d I don\u2019t care much about (I call them SMART TRADE-OFFS) ( + / \u2014 ) Camera/Picture quality (good enough for me), ( + / \u2014 ) Not for VR (still a \u201cniche\u201d use case), ( + / \u2014 ) Not waterproof (I don\u2019t swim with my phone), ( + / \u2014 ) No headphone jack (I love USB-C), ( + / \u2014 ) Weak built-in speaker (I use a headset or an actual high quality speaker when I need good/loud sound), ( + / \u2014 ) Unclear whether front facing camera will enable advanced face recognition use cases (the future is coming but I live in the present) The things I wish it did better (or \u201cWhy not a 5 star rating\u201d) ( \u2014 ) I\u2019d like the screen to be brighter / colors to be more vivid. Those with the current generation of iPhones won\u2019t necessarily mind, but for folks used to premium (AM)OLED phones (e.g. Samsung, Google Pixel, LG, etc.), it might very well be a deal breaker. ( \u2014 ) I\u2019d like the camera app to be better, starting with \u201cmanual\u201d mode (like what Motorola does). I am confident Andy\u2019s team will improve the camera app though, they already have in the past month as per the press. This phone is right for me, but is it right for you? The kind of user I am - I live in the cloud. I love Google services (and Amazon\u2019s too!). I appreciate Apple\u2019s \u201cless is more\u201d design principles and the superb quality and durability of their products, but I don\u2019t like that it is often \u201ctheir way or no way\u201d. - I use my phone a lot, mostly as a work tool (+ videos, and a few games for my kids). - I have 121 apps installed (for those who care to know, I included my home screen with the 30 or so that I use daily). - I am on T-Mobile. - I am \u201ccheap\u201d (or to put it nicely: \u201csavvy\u201d). I don\u2019t like to pay for the brand premium or the fanciness I don\u2019t need. I am fine paying for quality or \u201cfair trade / eco friendliness\u201d, but I have found that \u201chigh quality on the basics\u201d and \u201cinexpensive\u201d actually align * Oct 18 update: 50 days in, I am sticking with the Essential Phone. But I confirm my \"not for everyone\" comment. I think for most people, the Pixel 2 is a better choice (congrats team Google!) * Day 50: new pros and new cons (+) It still looks like new despite my having used it without a case. That is very impressive (I tend to bend my phones, or scratch them, or both)! (+) The charger Andy's team included is AMAZING (it must have been pricey). I can easily charge my laptop with it (USB C) (-) The camera is starting to bother me. I downloaded another camera app... (-) The power button below the volume button seems suboptimal to me (-) That phone is slippery... I haven't found an elegant solution (I really dont want to add a skin or a case, but I'll keep looking (ideas?) Comparison with Pixel 2 If you want stock Android, and a phone that just works, the default choice is Google's Pixel. So I got the Pixel 2 (disclosure: I know and admire the team who built it) *Where PH1 wins* - It has a much bigger screen despite being slightly smaller than the Pixel 2, which means a better browsing experience, more apps on the home screen. You just see more (see the pictures). - PH1 seems more durable to me. Pixel 2's coating looks like a great improvement over last year's metallic paint (that tended to chip off quickly), but I don't think it will beat ceramic and titanium. * Where Pixel 2 wins * - Pixel's camera is AWESOME. Even I became an ok photographer. It is incredibly fast, and the pictures turn out super sharp, with great colors, etc. The movies are amazing as well. - much better speaker (and there are 2 of them) - UI significantly more responsive - Water proof - Squeezable assistant is cute and may create a warm emotional bond... we shall see *One more thing* I now have the 360 degree camera and I must say I really like it",

                "review_text": "I've been using the Essential Phone for close to a month now, and am currently reviewing it after receiving my Pixel 2 phone a few days ago to test both. After playing around with the controversial camera on both devices, I am happy with returning my Pixel 2 in a few days. Make no mistake, the Pixel 2 has a wonderful camera. Even after sideloading the Google Camera app on to the Essential Phone, there were still noticeable differences in the low-light picture quality and the camera speed. I even compared them both with the iPhone X, and the Pixel 2 still arguably came out on top. But aside from that, I can't say that the Pixel 2 has anything else that I don't get with the Essential Phone, personally. Waterproofing is nice, but I've never dropped my phone in any body of water in the 10 years I've been owning a cellphone. Stereo speakers are also nice, but I use them about once a week at highest frequency. Google's timely updates do sound very tempting, but I'm very happy that Essential has just rolled out their Oreo beta a week ago, with the final build coming this year. This leaves the physical build, price, screen and battery life as the determining factors. The build quality and aesthetics of the Essential wins hands-down for me. No contest there. So is the price. I got my Essential for $400 (after taking advantage of Amazon's additional $50 gift card promo). And the Pixel 2 is priced at $740 (after the $115 trade-in credit I'd get with my old Nexus). The $300 difference is quite stark at this point. OLED is nice. Sure. But after using the 5.7in display on the Essential, I don't think I can go back to the meager 5in display found in the Pixel 2. The higher contrast attributed to the OLED panel found in the Pixel 2 is nice, but the difference is barely noticeable. The main beneficiary of this technology would be the lower power usage. Which brings me to the battery. The 3000mah battery found in the Essential should make up for the extra juice required to run the LCD panel. After testing both for the past few days, I can't say if there's a clear winner between the two. The Pixel 2's smaller battery can be compensated by the better software optimization by Google to ensure one full day of use. Essential might still have a few kinks to iron out with their software to ensure they don't unintentionally drain the battery life through poor software optimization. Both have been giving me full-day use with more than enough to spare (25%-50% left in the tank on a good day). In the end, I feel like the Essential is a better match for me. Your opinion and needs might differ, but I hope this review gave you some additional peace of mind before taking the lunge. Cheers!",

                "review_text": "Oh what to say? Disappointment? I researched this phone a lot. I work in tech. It came down to this or the pixel 2. I prefer small phones and not phablets. I chose essential because it's different, it's a small form factor, the large screen real estate relative to size of phone, and flagship specs. The recent discount was the tipping point. Go with the essential, right? Who cares it doesn't have an sd card slot, an aux input for audio, or amoled display. This actually looks very good in the sun. Fact it's LCD is ok. So why 3 stars? Bugs...freaking bugs! How else do you explain after four days of use pretty consistent freezing and lack of touch recognition with very light use? My phone has updated twice since it arrived from amazon last Saturday, Oct. 28. Nothing has improved. I was texting today...texting..and my phone froze for a good 3 seconds while I tried to text a response back. Really? I'm not playing games on this. I'm texting, surfing the web, using gps, pretty much \"essential\" stuff, right? Imagine this phone in a year, or two years, with these issues. I visited the android forums to find out why. Turns out these are hit and miss issues and certainly they exist for many buyers. I'm giving this a week before sending it back and buying a pixel 2. I like underdogs. I support start ups. This phone, though, needs to be fixed soon or I'm sending it back. Even at 500...I can't recall the last time I,spent this much and has similar issues. Essential, fix this phone! I want to support you.",

                "review_text": "DISCLAIMER: This is purely my experience, your opinion and experience will vary, naturally. With most of my smartphone experience being on Android, I was letdown to say the least with all the typical inconsistencies and experiences I had over the years. The last year or so I was using an iPhone and pretty much got used to iOS and incorporating the features and nuances to my workflow day in and day out but missed the freedom of Android dearly. Being an avid Android enthusiast and devouring any bit of Essential phone news I can find since it was initially announced, it was hard to resist at least trying it before committing to the iPhone further with the recent iPhone 8 Plus. Going into the Sprint store and seeing the Essential phone their and having some quick hands-on time with it, I was immediately impressed with the hand-in feel. Having read countless reviews with so much high praise going to the build quality, I was in complete agreement after my time with it. The thought of such a high end Android phone and with the backing of Andy Rubin as the project's leader, it was very hard to pass up and I am so glad I didn't pass on it. It was definitely an Ahhh moment when I opened to box, I probably put too much emphasis on presentation but I am so glad I'm not the only one that obsesses over small details. The unboxing tells you that this is a special device and Essential took extra care in making sure you know that they thought so too. The build quality is unlike any other phone I've held and I have about a dozen high end phones from every smartphone era dating back to 2007 and smartphone platform. Also details like the beautiful braided USB-C charging cable with metal end caps and the metal 27W charging brick, you rarely if ever see such attention being paid to the included accessories. Build quality, presentation aside, focusing on the phone and how it is to use. For me for the most part, it is a joy to use. Running as pure Android as you will find (Pixel isn't pure AOSP Android anymore like Nexus was), everything is generally smooth and fast. Having the latest Snapdragon 835 will do that and a 2017 standard for RAM at 4GB is also good enough for most anything you wanna throw at it. Those who have complained about camera quality and camera speed, I will say first off that I am not a heavy camera user on a smartphone, only taking pictures on occasion so the best camera isn't a high requirement for me, if it is to you, you may want to look at the LG V30 or the S8/S8+, Pixel or iPhone. Overall usability to me is far more important and being able to quickly transition between apps/screens is a joy to experience on a device with no bloatware to speak of, just clean Android as Andy Rubin intended with this device. If build quality, up to date Android releases, a fast, fluid UI experience are things you value then you can't go wrong with the Essential.",

                "review_text": "tl;dr 1. This phone is amazing in many ways 2. Most reviews from pre-November were based on at least 3 software updates behind the current version and much has improved. 3. When you get this phone and it asks you to install one update, you are not done: you must go to to settings->about phone->system update and check for another one. You must repeat this process until it tells you that \"Your system is up to date\". If you don't do this then you are likely still on old, buggier versions of the software. I'm guessing that some of the recent reviewers here have not done this. My moto x pure had been a great phone, but I needed to replace it for two reasons: the battery was never great and getting worse as it aged, and I was getting tired of carrying this giant thing in my pocket. If not for those things I would have hung on to it. What I wanted in a new phone: everything that was great about the moto x pure: runs Android; great looking, large, and very bright screen; great audio from the front facing stereo speakers; great camera; no bloatware; a quick way to launch the camera which was the same whether locked or unlocked; fast and smooth; durable and scratch-resistant; a headphone jack. To that list I added some things that the moto was not good at or never had: long battery life, being small enough to use one-handed and not be bursting out of my pocket, and a fast, accurate fingerprint reader. I looked at and rejected lots of phones, none of them had everything I wanted. Does the essential phone have everything I wanted? No way, but it's better than the rest for me for the following reasons. Pros ------ * Screen: A large, beautiful, responsive screen in the smallest size. When you pull this phone out of your pocket, hold it in your hand, reach across the screen with one hand, and look at the great screen, you'll probably get what I'm saying. * Speed: Very fast and smooth operation. No stuttering or other slowdowns. Runs the fastest Android processor currently available, same as on the S8 and others costing much more. * Camera launch: Can launch the camera quickly and easily, the same way, regardless of whether it's locked, screen off, or I'm using it. * Speaker: Very loud and clear *Battery: amazing battery life, looks like it will allow for 2-3x the screen on time of the moto x which ranged from 2 to 3 hours. * Bloatware: Android on the Essential is even more pure than that of my moto x pure edition * Fingerprint sensor: this one is very fast and accurate, it's great to have one finally. The one small problem is that it's not recessed very far into the body, so it can be slightly tricky to find sometimes. But it's so fast and accurate that usually getting in the vicinity of the center works for me. * Ambient light sensor: works perfectly, always at a good level for me no matter where I am. * GPS: perfect * Updates: Supported by a small, hungry startup which cares so much about the success of their product that they will push out multiple updates in a month. The larger companies and the carriers don't seem to care that much. Oreo should be coming soon, and unlike with other companies, I believe it. * Security: 3 years promised monthly security updates (My moto x pure went for almost a year without a security update, and I don't think that's unusual). * Storage: Huge amount of storage, 128GB * Price: And, perhaps best of all, the price. I was lucky enough to get this phone at what was probably the lowest price it will ever see, less than half the price of a similarly equipped pixel 2 XL or Galaxy S8 plus. The price has already gone up a bit, I recommend that you get it before it goes higher. OK ----- * Speaker: I was hoping to get front facing speakers like I had in the moto, but those days are over, I think, and it's well worth losing that for the small size. Despite the lack of front facing speakers, the single downward facing speaker on this phone is louder than the moto and seems just as clear. But you can cover it somewhat easily with your hand, as in any other phone with this type of speaker. * Camera: You've probably heard many complaints about the camera. Some of them have likely been addressed by recent updates, but there are still some issues. I haven't tested it extensively yet, but so far it seems to be not quite as good as the moto x pure. The pure camera has been fantastic for me, so a small downgrade is not a big deal for me. And I'm hoping it will get better with updates. I have not yet tried the ripped Google camera apk that others have had success with. * USB-C: had to happen sooner or later, but I'm not happy about having to buy more cables and chargers, and not being able to use the same on the other devices in my house Cons ------- * Headphone jack: I'm just gonna have to get used to not having one. Not ideal, but it was getting to be a pain to plug in every time I got in the car; I bought a bluetooth car receiver along with the phone. * Water resistance: I was looking forward to having a phone that I could use without fear in the water, but this phone is not it. * Flashlight: I really liked the chop gesture to turn on the moto flashlight. I used that all the time when I needed quick light and didn't want to have to unlock my phone, pull down the notifications, and tap on the flashlight. Every phone should have something like this.",

                "review_text": "I've been using this phone for ~2 months with daily use ranging from extensive to moderate. The decision to purchase this phone came with much trepidation - reviews in 20017 were sour on the phones camera, lag, screen jitters, and cost. However, the patches and new software releases were generating positive momentum for the phone. The price drop was the final motivation to purchase this phone as a replacement for my Nexus 6. After 2 months of solid use, I have absolutely no complaints - in fact, I love this phone. I'm a big fan of an unmolested Android UI and this has exactly what I'm looking for. As a former owner of all of the larger device manufacturers (Motorola, LG, HTC, Apple, etc.), the customized OEM \"skin\" have yielded little benefit other than expedited battery drain. Essential staying with a stock Android UI allows the PH-1 to operate very fast, hold a charge for almost 2 days with moderate use, and supports honest multi-tasking. Like you, the camera feedback was a big concern for me. The camera reviews received little love, and from what I read, this was deserved. However, when I received the phone, 3 updates were immediately available so the low light issues and slow shutter speed challenges never appeared. In fact, last night I received another camera update. The new portrait feature has been put through the paces on the phone and is a great feature with solid results. At this point, I'd stack the camera on this phone up to almost any phone with the possible exception of Samsung and Pixel. So think about it, there are dozens of other phone manufactures that produce similar if not inferior photo quality to the Essential PH-1. Using the last 6 months as a barometer, the velocity of updates for the camera that we have seen will certain further enhancement photo quality and eliminate all of the concerns for the point and shoot recreational photographer. The bezel-less screen, color contrast, and sharpness are on par with my Apple iPhone. When comparing the screen size to the Apple 8 Plus, the Essential PH-1 has a larger overall useful screen size (eliminating the dead black space around the iPhones's screen). The benefit is a mini-phablet display without the bulk and size of a large phone that I would struggle to put in my pant pocket or mount to a dashboard phone holder. I haven't bench marked the performance of this phone against others as others have done this and you can find the objective data on various Android sites. The objective data speaks very positively for this phone. Historically, I have found that the 2 or 3 month mark is the best time to look back at a phone and determine if the right phone was purchased. Did it perform to my expectations, are there shortfalls that amplified themselves, would I buy this phone again, etc.? In all cases, I'm very pleased with the phone. The areas where I had low expectations, the phone has proven to shine and the concerns weren't manifested. The only features/attributes I wish this phone had were waterproofing and wireless charging. I've grown accustomed to the missing headphone jack but would really like to see the other items addressed in the next iteration of this phone. Based on my demand for a phone and daily usage demand, I would highly recommend this phone. To date, it is the best phone I've owned.",

                "review_text": "Migrated to the PH-1 as a former Samsung flagship owner (most recently the S6 Edge), preceded by a Nexus and a Motorola. People close to me have owned iPhones and Samsungs, which I've played around with frequently, so I've had a good sampling of the flagship products for the past several years. I'll say that, unequivocally, the Essential PH-1 is the best-designed phone I've ever owned, by a wide margin. As noted by many others, its industrial design and overall 'feel' is second-to-none. This thing is an absolute joy to use. Once in a blue moon I'm lucky enough to buy something that delights me every time I use it, see it, or pick it up; the PH-1 is exactly such a thing. I read widely about the phone before purchasing it, and the negative reviews made me sufficiently leery to cancel my pre-order. I then took the plunge in a moment of weakness, and I'm extremely glad I did. I won't spend too much time on this review, but I will say that I think the press the PH-1 has gotten has been grossly unfair (and, honestly, almost conspicuously brutal). As press has an outsized influence on customers' initial impressions of a product, I really don't think this outstanding phone has gotten anything close to a fair shake. I also worry about the negative press's potential to take down what has established itself as a company focused on quality and innovation. Problems? You'll read everywhere that the camera needs some work. Yes, it does. My only real complaints have been on zoomed-in photos, which can look very grainy/pixelated. Anything else is on par with the photos from my S6 Edge, though, whose quality I don't recall being universally condemned. Also, as you'll read elsewhere, the monochrome camera is brilliant; the black & whites are deep & contrasty, and really quite beautiful. Lag/stutter? I haven't seen any whatsoever. Must've been addressed in an update. Reception? Every bit as good as my S6 Edge (and note that Cricket Wireless is my carrier). I honestly have absolutely no idea why this phone isn't being considered as a contender for greatest of 2017. It's easily the best purchase I've made all year, and easily the best phone I've ever owned.",

Had trouble deciding between buying the Pixel 2 XL and this phone to replace my venerable Nexus 6P. Last year's Pixels didn't impress me. My decision making process may be different from yours. My check boxes: Need an option other than Oreo for now since a couple of my must-have apps don't work on Oreo. Big high res screen for my older eyes and big fingers. No headphone jack is not a deal-breaker. Smaller pocket size phone is better as long as the screen is big enough. Good battery life. Hate bloatware. Biggish storage. Camera needs to be decently good for reliable use in social settings. I only need photos at a quality/resolution consistent with unlimited Google photo storage. If I need a Nikon, will bring it instead. I have owned all the iphones up to 8, all the Nexus phones, and Samsungs through the 6 model year. I've played with the latest iOS offerings. This thing is very pretty and appears durable with its ceramic back, titanium sides, and gorilla front - but I bought a case anyway. The white does not show fingerprints on the ceramic like the black does. It just feels right. It's the same feeling I got with the iphone 4 at the time - if you can remember that far back. That was so much different than the other stuff on the market. I don't mourn the lack of a SD card because it comes with 128 GB standard. Doesn't feel gimmicky or bloated. Solid is the best way to describe the feel. I can't believe that the 6P and this thing have about the same size screen and this phone's body is so much smaller due to the tiny bezels. The camera notch at the top of the screen doesn't cause any trouble with the apps I use. No back camera hump. I think the non-amoled screen is stunning (at 1312 x 2560). No bloat. Only non-stock app is the camera app. Multiple camera software updates after it got initial poor camera reviews on first release. The updates make the camera much better. You can also load a patched version of the Google pixel camera app. I'm used to that so mostly using the Google port now. You can read about it on xda-developers.com. I've found both are more than fine for taking photos that I would enjoy by looking at them on a screen instead of in print. I think it takes better pics than my old 6P or old iphone 6 Plus when I compare. I think the new iphone and the new pixel do a bit better - but from my perspective, not $400-$600 bucks better. If you make your living with cell phone pics then spend double. NFC reader is on the bottom where the only real bezel is. Speaker is good. Hole for mic is very near the hole for the sim so put your pin in the correct one when installing sim. I ran it on the T-mobile and Verizon network without problem. There is a new T-mobile phone comparability app and it lists this phone as compatible with all their advanced features. No lags or crashes or app problems in a week of use. It did three updates since I had it including the latest security patches. This is my new daily driver. No pocket problems - did I mention big screen in a physically small phone. Battery duration is quite good. Don't miss the headphone jack yet. Might just go buy another one when the 360 camera comes back into stock. Hope this company keeps building nice things.",

                "review_text": "I just received my white PH-1 today (15 Nov 2017 - 10 days faster than the estimated delivery date, thank you Amazon and i-parcel). The build quality is really impressive, words don't do justice to describe it, you need to experience it yourself. According to a lot of reviewers, camera app is the weakest feature of the phone, so that's the first thing I tried when I turn on the phone for the first time. So far the camera app performance is good enough for me, both shutter speed and image saving time are fast, also the photo looks good for me even in low light. I'll update my review later once I experience it for one week or two. Update - 26 Nov 2017 After 10 days with the phone, I'm very pleased, below are my positive points: + The phone stay much cooler when using WhatsApp call compared to my iPhone 7. + The battery life is great, for my usage it took 40% (from 8 AM to 8 PM) with 2 hours screen on time, I mostly use WhatsApp and browsing. Regarding the negative: [-] Delay in saving the picture when using the default camera app (this don't bother me too much as I didn't take photo that often) How I setup my phone: 1. I use immersive mode by installing 'Navigation Bar Hider' to hide the navigation bar. 2. All in one gesture to create gesture for: home, back, recent apps. Cheers.",

                "review_text": "** UPDATED REVIEW ** Well, hoping it was just a case of bad luck I ordered another phone. Just finished testing it and you know what.. I do not think I got a bad phone, I think they all have issues. After doing a lot of research I found out that Essential has issues with the T-Mobile carrier. Now, I was an AT&T user before I moved over to TracFone to save about 1/2 of what AT&T was charging me for 3 phones on a \"family\" plan. Anyway I have no idea who's service TracFone is using all I know is that my 4 year old S5 has a rock solid 4G/LTE connection in my office and the PH-1 cycled between NO bars to FULL bars on the second phone as well. Its sad because there us SO much to love about this phone... Build quality is fantastic, design is beautiful, updates are plentiful. The one area that this phone falls totally flat on its face is RECEPTION. What use is a phone that can not make or receive calls. USELESS!!! Not sure if I got a lemon or what but the one undeniable fact is that a cell phone is a phone first and foremost. Well the unit I got connected up to my carrier just fine and I was able to make test calls. After that I noticed that by signal strength bar would flux from full to none at random, just sitting on my desk. USELESS PHONE....",

                "review_text": "I have waited nearly 60 days before I judged this phone. There was such big hype surrounding the phone, it was going to be difficult for it to live up to it's initial excitement. I have to say the best way to describe the essential phone phone is that it is the only phone that I have owned in the past 5 years that I haven't lost the \"wow\" feeling, even after 2 months. The build and design is unmatched in today's market (imho) The way the phone feels is hard to describe, it is perfect in my opinion, it feels expensive in your hand, but not to heavy, screen is a perfect size and I haven't had any issues with the LCD display. Are the blacks as deep as a OLED, no, but the picture is super crisp and I was shocked at how good it looked coming immediately from my Google pixel. Were there intial issues, yes. The camera app when it was released was awful. I say the app because it cannot be the camera, due to the promised updates that have made the phone on par with other flagships, it has truly been a pleasure to see the updates as Essential roles them out, every time I am shocked at the amount of improvement. It feels like a completely different phone today than it did at launch (in a good way) The 360 camera has been the same way, initially it crashed constantly, didn't take perfect or even great photos, but the updates have made a night and day difference. It is something that not everyone will use daily, but very neat for vacations and just to play around with. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and even more happy I made the descision since seeing all the issues the pixel 2 is having. I truly hope essential can hang on and grow into a true competitor in the market, because if this is their first attempt, look out. Lastly some pros and cons Pros: Amazing design Perfect size Battery life Qaulity of build Promised updates have made a huge difference Stock Android Monochrome photos are awesome Love the look of the screen notch Durability (2 months without a case, several drops, and no issues) Cons: Took to long to intially release phone, lost a lot of sales Camera app on initial release was awful (lost a lot of credibility in the public eye), but updates have made it a pro No real good option for cases yet (due to 360 camera needing to clip on back) No stereo speakers No waterproofing (maybe next model)",

First of all, I LOVE stock Android and that is what you get with this. Only what you want and nothing else. Performance after a week of heavy use is great. Silky smooth and not so much as a stutter. Battery life is good lasting me 16 hours with about 4 hours of screen time. Lasts much longer with less screen time. LCD screen is very clear, but is hard to see in directly sun light. Build quality is great. Phone reception on AT&T is much better and clearer than my Active S7 was. VoLTE does work, but no WiFI calling with AT&T. The camera is just really bad. In bright settings it's ok, but even indoors with any sort of lighting you get terrible light flare. Any sort of movement will create horrible blurry photos. I did install the ported Google Camera app from XDA and it helped, but not much. I am going to wait as long as I can to hope the deliver a firmware fix, but if not it will probably need to go back. Camera is important to me.",

I use my phone quite often during the day. When I go to bed, the battery is at about 40-50%. Which is phenomenal. And if you use it more, it is fast charging capable with it's own charger. Love the 360\u00b0 camera too. It isn't the greatest I've experienced but buying the phone on sale for $349 with the camera INCLUDED I really can't complain. Response to everything clicked on and loading is quite responsive. Haven't experienced any lag and I usually have at least a few apps going at once. The camera is better than average as well. The landscapes are exceptional. Especially sunsets as the camera is phenomenal in low light. I'm not all too knowledgeable of phones and their components and such but as the average smartphone user the essential ph1 is perfect to me.",

I have had this phone now since it came out and yes, it did have some problems with screen lag and no touch/ghost touch but security updates and fixes have been coming steadily. We are now up to Oreo 8.1 and this phone FLIES! No more jitter, lag and phunny business. I could not be happier with this phone. I also love the 360 cam. You can take some really amazing pics with this thing! 360 inside a castle, check. 360 in a botanical garden, check. Truly beautiful. It sucks a ton of the very amazing battery when you use the cam but other than that I can go a whole day and still have juice left over . Very happy I was an early adopter, the growing pains have been worth it for me. Be together, not the same.

Not OLED, but it's an excellent screen that gets bright enough to see outdoors - stock, clean Android. No bloat, no useless extras. CONS: - cell reception is HORRIBLE. I can't even think of the last time I had to worry about this, but with this phone I always had to worry about dropped calls and not having reception when I knew t-mobile had signal there. Compared to a Pixel, this has about 10dBm less on average. There are many places where the pixel had service where this phone just didn't. Data speeds were also considerably higher on the Pixel. For this reason alone, if you're on T-Mobile, I would avoid this phone and look elsewhere. - touch scrolling. They said they \"fixed\" this with the most recent update. Nope. If you hold down your finger while scrolling, it's very jittery. It feels like you're scrolling with a mouse wheel and the screen jumps around instead of smoothly scrolling. You would think it's not a huge deal, but it gets annoying VERY quickly. - camera. It's bad, really bad. Even using the ported Google Camera APK, it's nowhere near Pixel/iPhone quality. But I guess that's okay now since this phone is considerably cheaper than those. The essential camera app is just horrible, download the Google Camera immediately.",

Really, it is, like i really tried to like it, it has a beautiful exterior, the screen resolution is amazing! But the software is just bad, even though it's android stock, it just crashes a lot, it freezes, sometimes it just stops working and it resets itself. Also another thing, i currently live in South Korea and i am using KT network and it doesn't really work, well it does but not fully, it is capable of using the Data, and text messaging, but phone calls?? One of the most important things, NO, IT DOES NOT WORK! It does not take phone calls and it does not make phone calls. Like are you serious? And i am kinda stuck with this phone, because i can't just go and spend another 500 dollars for another phone that is just insane. Sure there is some good sides to this phone, like i mention the screen resolution, even though it is not an amoled screen it's still surprisingly good. The battery is really good, at least for me, but its just too bad that all of these software bugs are just making what could be a good phone, a terrible one. One of the things that i really enjoy about this phone even though everyone else seems to hate its the camera, i really enjoy the mono camera, the regular camera, its not that great but the mono works just good enough for me. so there is that, that is the only thing keeping me from throwing this device against a wall to be completely honest. So in short, no, do not buy this phone, really don't. It is not worth it, too many bugs, like literally all i use is social medias and it can't really handle it. It crashes.

The screen is great. It's blazing fast and stripped of all bloatware. I'm not a photobug so I couldn't really say if the camera is good or bad. The biggest improvement over the samsung has to do with unlocking. With work software on phone, fingerprint unlock is a must. With my S7 it was: push home button to wake up, wait for fingerprint to register, then swipe up to unlock. In exactly that order. With the PH-1, it's put a finger on the sensor and voila, the phone is ready to go. I miss the wireless charging but with the upcoming magnetic cradle, I think I'll be good to go. This phone has everything I need: rock solid construction, blazing fast performance, easy to unlock and actually use, a big vivid screen in a small form factor, and plenty of storage.

                "review_text": "UPDATE (10/4/17): I've been using this phone for about a month, and my impressions after a month have been added at the end of this review. I've also docked my initial review by one star for the reasons detailed in that addition. UPDATE (11/27/17): Due to multiple requests, I've added photos comparing this phone to another large phone, the Nexus 6. From the photos, you can clearly see that despite the Essential being, edge-to-edge, a significantly smaller phone, the usable screen space is pretty close, due to the near-bezel-less screen on the Essential. In one of the photos, you can also see how Amazon Prime Video uses nearly every bit of that extra space, including the space near the camera opening. As you assuredly know, if you're reading this review, Essential is a new phone hardware company, and this is their first offering. They've made quite a splash because the company was founded by the guy who invented Android for Google. Darn good bonafides, as they say. The assertion is that this phone, the Essential PH-1, is a smart phone done right. Top end construction, high end components, absolutely no third party bloatware on top of pure Android, and compatible with each and every cell carrier. Oh, let's not forget, overseen by the guy who started the company who, you might expect, as Mr. Android, knows how it should be done. Well, promises and anticipation are one thing. Does this phone actually deliver? Before I get to that, let me describe my list of what the \"world's best\" smart phone SHOULD offer: \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591Must haves:\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2756 Fantastic battery life. You shouldn't be sweating bullets that your phone will still have juice at the end of a normal day. \u2756 Great camera. If you're going to pay for a world class phone, it had better have a world class camera. \u2756 Excellent phone call quality: Sound for both the caller and the called, and the reception. \u2756 Headphone jack. Yeah, I'm going there. I've not heard a single convincing argument to remove the phone jack. Making the phone insignificantly thinner? Come on. And Samsung and others have demonstrated you can make a waterproof phone without removing the jack. Removing the jack is change for change's sake. And if you have been an important phone call via a Bluetooth headset when suddenly there's Bluetooth interference, you know why removing the jack is just idiocy. Oh, and to those who argue \"you can use a standard headphone with a special dongle\": Thank you, but adding a component that can easily be lost and juts out from the sleek lines of the phone is just wrong. \u2756 At least 3Gb memory. (And 4Gb memory is better, to provide a safe buffer today, and for some element of future-proof). \u2756 At least 32Gb storage. More is nicer, of course. But 32Gb is the minimum amount that leaves ample space for the OS, your apps, and a bunch of pictures before you have to do the dreaded storage triage. \u2756 A multi-year roadmap for providing OS updates, and providing those updates in a timely manner. Not just 1-2 years, like most manufacturers, but as long as the hardware can reasonably support the latest OS. \u2756 Unlockable bootloader and rootable. If you don't know what these are, that's OK. But a high end phone should provide full control over what's on the phone to advanced users who might want to play with it. \u2756 Compatibility with all the major US carriers (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint) and with most world carriers. Because you don't want your expensive phone investment to be a consideration in choosing the best plan. \u2756 A good, modern processor: I was ambivalent about even putting this on the list, since each and every modern flagship phone, and even most affordable midline phones, has a processor more than sufficient to provide an entirely acceptable experience. For most users, we are far beyond the point where any negative user experience issues are processor related. But obviously, a slow doggy processor (if you could find one) would be a deal breaker for an ideal phone. \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591Should haves:\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2756 Wireless charging. Once you've used it, you won't want to go back. \u2756 Fast charging: Nothing like charging your phone from 0 to a usable level in less than 10 minutes. If you've ever been twisted in contortions huddled in the corner next to a power outlet because your phone is out of juice and you have an important call coming up, you'll know what I mean. \u2756 High resolution front camera. Because, admit it, we all like selfies. \u2756 Front firing speakers. Because any time you use your phone in speakerphone mode, it's facing you and so should the speakers. \u2756 More than 32Gb storage and/or a SD slot. \u2756 A removable battery. Because, eventually, your battery is going to start going bad. No, not maybe. \u2756 High resolution screen. Personally, I think higher pixel densities are, after a point, just a marketing scam (and one that robs battery life). A 320 dpi pixel density is more than sufficient for anything you're going to do on a phone, even if you are a image snob. \u2756 Pure Android experience. No one likes \"bloatware\" (you know, the junk apps your provider insists on installing on your phone, such as their inferior mapping program). And while some of the add on navigation software that companies like Samsung add is OK, mostly it isn't necessary and makes your phone more likely to encounter software hiccups (and delayed OS updates). \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591Nice to have:\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2756 Fingerprint reader. Entering a pin isn't so hard. But a fingerprint reader is easier. \u2756 Waterproof. Honestly, I have never, ever, wanted to use my phone in the water. But it's nice to think that if you accidentally drop it in the sink it's not toast. If you accidentally drop it in the toilet, it SHOULD be toast. \u2756 A \"shatterproof\" screen. Truth is that there are no shatterproof screens. Motorola has some models that promise this, but they are simply less shatter prone. So let's say it would be nice to have a less shatter prone screen. \u2756 High quality case materials. Sure, a nice case is sleek and impressive out of the box. But day-to-day, after you have your initial blitz of bragging to your friends, it doesn't have that much to do with your experience. \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591No one cares:\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2756 Thinner. All modern smartphones are more than thin enough to fit comfortably in your hand and in your pocket. Carving bits off the thickness that are barely measurable with a micrometer is just marketing nonsense--especially since the majority of people use a phone case that makes whatever's being shaved off irrelevant. OK, that's my scorecard for a world class smartphone. How does the Essential do? \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591Must Haves\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591: \u2756 Battery life: It has good-but-not-great-for-flagship battery life (it made it to the end of the day with normal use, although in my case [I do a lot of surfing during the day], just barely). It's not near as as good as my several year old Droid Turbo and not as good as it could be with the bigger battery in phones made by competitors. The battery is 3040mAh in size. I'll give it half a check mark for this. 0.5 check. \u2756 Camera: Oh my. A big disappointment. The Essential uses a dual camera sensor system, one color, one monochrome, and asserts this will allow fabulous pictures even in low light. But...just no. The pictures were all generally very good in good lighting. But once the lighting was less than good...they were all over the place--some good, some fuzzy, few outstanding. I compared pictures of the same subjects with a friend who has a Pixel (currently considered by many the best camera phone out there), and it was no contest: In all cases where it wasn't a tie, the Pixel took better shots in the same conditions. The Pixel was also considerably faster in processing pictures. The Essential camera was pretty laggy in taking multiple shots, particularly with HDR on. Reading various information on the Web, there were numerous reports that the camera quality improved with updates so I made sure I had the latest camera update. I did. And the camera wasn't hideous. I mean, this would be considered very good quality relative to phones from a few generations ago. But it's not quite where it should be for a flagship, particularly one that is promising so much with the dual camera lens setup. I'll add that the controls for the camera are very limited in scope...much more so than, say, those for the Pixel. But I would add that I rarely use the advanced camera settings. So for me that's not so much a problem as is the fact that the camera quality could be better. 0.0 check. \u2756 Call quality: The phone call quality is very good on my end and people I called said I sounded unusually clear for a cellphone. Speaker quality was good, too--acceptably loud, although a bit tinny. The Essential got the same or more bars in places with poor coverage as did my other phones (Droid Turbo, Nexus 6, iPhone 6). 1.0 check. \u2756 Headphone jack: No, they went there. No headphone jack. Tim Cook's folly is now spreading. On the upside, the Bluetooth on the phone easily paired with my favorite Bluetooth headphones (Jaybird J3). But no headphone jack still makes me sad. 0.0 check. \u2756 Memory: 4Gb. Excellent. The current flagship standard. Enough memory, even if you have multiple apps opened. 1.0 check. \u2756 Storage: 128Gb, not expandable. But with 128Gb, who cares if you can expand it. That's swimmingly sufficient and then some. 1.0 check. \u2756 Multi-year roadmap: The Essential company hasn't promised more than 2 years of updates, a promise the same as, but no better than, such competitors as Google. That said, they've made a huge deal of this being a phone for your many year future, and if I were being optimistic, I'd interpret that to mean they plan to offer updates for more than 2 years. But of course there's always the question of where this very young company will be in multiple years. So fingers crossed, but no data. Given lack of data, no check mark can be assigned for this. \u2756 Unlockable bootloader and rootable: The Essential company has promised that the bootloader will be unlockable, but how to unlock it isn't yet clear. I assume that if we get that, root will follow. But again, wait and see. 1.0 check (taking company at its pre-release word). \u2756 Compatibility with all major US carriers: Yes. Even the dreaded Verizon (although at the time of this writing you may have an issue if you are not already a Verizon customer and are trying to use this phone on the big V--but Essential promises that will be resolved soon). 1.0 check. \u2756 Processor: This phone has the Qualcomm 835 processor. It's this year's flagship phone processor of choice (also used by the Samsung S8, the Motorola Moto Z2 Force, and others). It's an octa-core processor clocked at 2.4ghz). It may not be the fastest next year and...honestly, who cares? All these higher end processors are, at this point, sufficient to smoothly run anything the average user might do with their phone. The one important thing about having the latest and greatest is that there's a good chance that chipset drivers will be available and updated for the next few years, making it easier to provide OS updates. 1.0 check. \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591Should haves:\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2756 Wireless charging: Sadly, no. This one hurts. They are promising some sort of proprietary docking station (purchased separately) to allow wireless charging. But A) I hate having to pay more for that functionality later; and B) no need to reinvent the wheel. Existing Qi wireless charging works great--though not on this phone. 0 check. \u2756 Fast charging: Yes. Although it uses a new protocol, USB-C PD with QC 4.0. Lots of jargon to say: If you have fast/turbo chargers around, they won't work to provide fast charging with this phone. You need a new one. (It comes with one...If you want one for travel, you'll need to buy a new one...the ones you already have probably won't work, except as slow chargers). 1.0 check. \u2756 High resolution front camera: Yes! 8 glorious megapixels! (And a first: 4K video from the front facing camera). Let the Instagram parade begin. (Watch out for the boss...). Front facing picture quality is decent. 1.0 check. \u2756 Front firing speakers: No. Unfortunately, the edge-to-edge usable screen apparently makes this impossible. That said, I found the speaker volume with the phone facing me, to be fully loud enough (though tinny sounding). So I'll give it half a check mark for this. 0.5 check. \u2756 SD card storage: No. But with 128Gb standard, I don't care. 0.0 check. \u2756 Removable battery: No. Well, at least not trivially easily removable. We'll wait for the teardowns to figure out if you can do it with a little elbow grease. 0.0 check. \u2756 High resolution screen: This phone has a 5.7\" screen, 2560x1312 pixels, for a pixel density of 504ppi. That's far more than sufficient for any discerning user. Some of the competition has somewhat higher density on their flagships. Beyond bragging rights, I don't consider those differences significant. 1.0 check. \u2756 Pure Android Experience: Yes. 100% stock Android. 1.0 check. \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591Nice to Haves:\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2756 Fingerprint reader: Yes. And it's on the back, which, once you get used to it, makes a lot more sense than on the front. 1.0 check. \u2756 Waterproof: Nope. And, honestly, I don't care. 0.0 check. \u2756 Shatterproof screen: Nope. But as noted, there really isn't such a thing. The titanium and ceramic body is supposed to improve structural integrity and ability to withstand a fall. I'm not going to test that intentionally. But the titanium body won't protect the (Gorilla Glass) screen any better than any other if your phone falls in such a way that the glass screen hits the floor first. 0.0 check. \u2756 High quality case materials: Yes, the Essential is a no discussion winner here, fabricated from titanium and ceramic, along with a beautiful edge-to-edge screen on the front. 1.0 check. Summary and Conclusions \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 OK, so 6.5/9 of the must haves we can evaluate, with future updates an unknown. The camera currently a MAJOR disappointment. But given the improvements that have already been rolled out with software updates, one can hope (fingers crossed) that the camera with in short order get a lot better. The headphone jack isn't going to come back and that's sad. The battery is good enough (and I gave it a half a checkmark), but really isn't as big as I'd like. I am willing to have a thicker phone if it means a much better battery. Of the should haves, the phone only manages 4.5/8, with wireless charging a particularly egregious omission. For the nice to haves, it manages 2/4, but for one of those (superior materials) it leaves the pack in the dust. 6.5/9, 4.5/8 and 2/4...Good, similar to other flagship phones, though not quite the specs of the phone of my dreams. But it's worth noting a couple of other unique features of this phone. First off, it offers a unique modular system for adding modular functionality. These snap-on add-ons attach through magnets and a couple of small cutouts on the back of the phone. It's a pretty clever system. That said, the only add on currently available is a 360-degree camera attachment that holds absolutely no appeal to me. But one can imagine more interesting add-ons like a higher quality camera lens, a higher quality microphone, etc. Time will tell whether the potential of this ecosystem is realized, but the few attempts at modularity already attempted (e.g. LG, Motorola) haven't exactly set the world on fire. Second, and I've alluded to this earlier, the screen covers the ENTIRELY of the front of the phone. There are no hardware buttons. There is no bezel on the top or bottom of the phone. The image even covers the area around the small cutout for the front-facing camera. It's a lovely, engaging, experience, although I found that many apps weren't yet programmed to properly use the entirety of the full screen (leaving bands at the edges). On top of the above, you should know that this phone incorporates USB-C, the new USB standard that, unfortunately, isn't directly compatible with your old USB cables. So if you haven't already moved to USB-C, this phone will force you to... A couple of other nits I have to pick with this phone. First off, all you get in the package is the phone, a fast charger, a USB-C cable, a USB-C to headphone adapter, and a pin to access the sim card tray. (See the photo I've attached). Given the flagship high price of this kit, I would have liked to see a USB-C to micro-USB adapter (which lets you use your old cables with the new phone). Most people have a lot of micro-USB kit around and very little (or no) USB-C infrastructure. Samsung includes a USB-C to micro-USB adapter in their Galaxy S8 package (as well as wireless headphones, also not included with the Essential), and given that Essential is pushing us into a new standard, it seems the least they could have done. Put it another way: Because Essential cheaps out and doesn't include USB-C to USB-A or micro-USB adapters, unless you have a computer at home with USB-C connectivity, you CANNOT connect the phone to your computer for data transmission until you buy a third party adapter. The cable in the kit (USB-C to USB-C) won't work. Given how expensive this kit is and how few people have USB-C connectivity at the time of this phone's release, that's just ridiculous. Second, Essential has decided to move the power button to BELOW the volume buttons on the side of the phone. The power button lies about half way down the right side. Maybe it's just me, but I find this counter-intuitive, and find myself hitting the power volume button instead of the power button, or vice-versa. You should also know that the phone FORCES you to do an update when you first set it up. The update is a almost 900mb big, and takes about 20-30 minutes to download and install. Just a FYI: You'll want to be on good wireless and have some time before you start. On the whole, I find a lot to like about this phone, and some things--like the elegant high quality build and no bezel screen--to love. The Android OS runs very smoothly, apps install and launch fast, and call quality is good. Have they built one phone to rule them all, turn over all the cards, just buy it? No, not in my opinion. It's a good option at the flagship price point, but there are other good options at that price point, and construction and design aside, I am not sure this phone has sufficiently differentiated itself to say you shouldn't carefully consider your options. If Essential ultimately provides timely updates for a longer horizon than their competitors that would be a HUGE incentive to buy into their ecosystem. Heck, if I knew that they'd support Android updates until the hardware simply can't handle them, I'd say that all other caveats aside, this IS the phone to get. (I've got a drawer full of hardware-willing Android phones that were abandoned way too soon by their manufacturers). But that remains to be seen, even if the company us being run by the father of Android itself. \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 UPDATE (10/04/17): \u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591 OK, so I've owned this phone for about a month. I just received the third major firmware update, and these three updates have fixed some of the earlier bugaboos, particularly with respect to general functioning of apps. They have also improved the camera (though it's still a work in progress, it's generally good enough). The design choices that I hated up front I still find terribly annoying: No headphone jack; USB-C; no wireless charging built in. I have tons of wired headphone/micro-USB/Qi wireless charging infrastructure around my house and in my car, and this phone takes those away without any real benefit. But even with a just-good-enough camera and with the design choice headaches, in the past month I've come to love certain things about this phone: The form factor; the feel in my hand; the glassy smooth performance; the super fast booting; the lovely edge-to-edge display; and the (surprisingly) consistently excellent battery life. I WANT to love this phone, warts and all. Sadly, I can't. And beyond the more modest annoyances noted above, the fundamental reason is this: Unreliable cellular data service. I'm on Verizon, and this phone was properly provisioned on Verizon shortly after it was released. But the phone has a horrible tendency to lose its data connection. I'll have a four bar solid data connection. Then I'll enter a location with a recognized WiFi connection. The phone will switch to WiFi, but when I leave the WiFi area it doesn't properly return to cellular data. Sometimes it will even show a good strength data connection, but won't be able to connect to it. The only way to fix this is to reboot the phone. (Sometimes taking the phone into and out of airplane mode will also fix things, but sometimes it won't). The phone also has a tendency to get stuck on dirt-slow 3G even when there's a LTE connection available, and again the only way to force it to properly connect is to reboot the phone. As of the time of this update, this phone has the WORST ability to find and hold a solid data connection of any phone I have used on Verizon since the advent of LTE. I've tried to switch to this phone as my daily driver, but the issues with lost data connection when I'm moving around are so common and so aggravating that ultimately I find myself switching back to other phones whenever I will be in a situation where using my phone is mission critical. I keep hoping a firmware update will fix things, and that's why I waited to write this update until the just released update of today, but it didn't fix anything in this regard and so...well, I really do want to love this phone. But if the phone isn't going to love me back...well, you know...stay tuned...",

                "review_text": "Alright. I have been a part of the whole Apple extended family which seems like forever until Apple released a $1000 iPhone X. That's just too much money. So I bought the Essential Phone after reading about it and frankly for $399 (BF Deal) to get a Smartphone with snap-on camera and128 gb worth of space is a steal. The phone itself comes with: 1. Charger. 2. Dongle to connect earphones. Additional package: 1. Snap-on camera, 360 deg. I was able to download all the build updates/apps/sync my contacts etc in no time. However, porting my ringtones over from iPhone was a huge challenge. Since being a newbie on Andoird platform, I failed to understand why a file management system does not come pre-packaged with Android. However, I was able to get past it by downloading Android File Transfer on my mac and realizing that my ringtones were m4r format so spent some time converting them over to MP3 and boom had my ringtones appear on my Essential phone. Pros: 1. Camera: I like it. Nothing wrong with the native camera. I read so much about people complaining about crashes etc, but I had no issues so far. The quality is great although I have not installed the Google Camera APK and hence cannot compare the native camera functionality vs the Google Camera APK. 2. The Phone: Its super fast, simple to adapt to. Storage is great. I love the design. 3. Battery: This is definitely a selling point. The battery life is super long. Much much much better than any iPhone I have owned in the past 10 years. Cons: 1. No slot for earphones: I don't get the argument that the industry is heading this way hence we ought to accept it. No sorry, I have had issues with Bluetooth connectivity and worst yet, if the battery needs to be charged and you have an important work-related call that can't wait, then your screwed. The Type c - earphone dongle is all cute and sh*t but it just doesn't make up for a lost earphone slot. 2. Essential Phone: Looks like it was built for Android enthusiasts only hence I cannot find any starter kit or anything for non-Android users to hop on and know what to expect. Like how would you back up over wifi vs connected to a computer, just to name a few? Luckily I was able to find the XDA forums, which is a life saver for all issues relating to Essential phone: https://forum.xda-developers.com/essential-phone/help 3. A type c to USB cable: This is hardly a deal breaker since you can get one for $5 on Amazon but you would assume that the package would have a USB - Type c connector but there isn't one. I get that Essential is future proofing but many many existing laptops/macs do not have Type c input. Overall, at the moment I love the product. I have seen many people complain (perhaps their experience was bad) but the price point and the features that you get are great. I will update this comment in 3 weeks and hopefully, I could still associate the word love with this phone. ~Peace",

                "review_text": "I've come from a OnePlus 3T to the Essential Phone and am dumbfounded! The build is so impressive. I can't put the phone down! This is noticeably smaller than my previous phones, but the screen ratio more than makes me enjoy looking at and holding the phone. It just feels right, both with the physical hardware as well as the software. My usage so far has left me nothing short of impressed. After installing my apps, setting up my accounts, and testing things out I am confident that this phone will still be my daily driver for the next few years. Essential really has stepped up their game from what I have to compare with early reviews of the phone. The camera app works! There is a slight lag after a picture is taken to when it is added to your gallery, assuming this is just the software processing the image which seems like something that can be fixed with more updates. Speaking of updates, I'm still running Android 7.1 and haven't opted to join the 8.0 beta, but I really think this phone will be amazing with the latest version of Android! Anxiously awaiting! One other thing I wanted to note is network coverage; on the T-Mobile network I've never experienced any hiccups as others have reported. Network signal is strong, stronger than my previous 3T, and reliable. Wi-Fi speeds are impressive, staying consistent, which I've had nothing but trouble with other phones in the past. ***EDIT*** The battery life has been unbelievable! 7+ hours of screen on time, it can handle all my streaming needs (music and video!). By noon with my old 3T I would have had to charge my phone but with this wonderful slab I'm sitting pretty at 55-60% with just a few hours left of my day. I'm thrilled with this battery performance!! ***EDIT CONCLUDED*** At the current price point, current developer support, and hardware, there should be no second thoughts. This phone blew my expectations out of the water!",

                "review_text": "Andy Rubin basically designed a super awesome hardware, slapped the barebone Android OS on it and called it a day. So you have to do a lot of tweaks to make it work, for example - Just by increasing the screen touch sensitivity, I made the phone feel much faster and less stuttery - The vibration strength is also too strong and you need to hunt down the setting and reduce it. - Camera app is absolutely crap, using third party apps make it much better, but still no match for Samsung Galaxy and Pixel. That being said, I loved it, why? - Firstly it just feels special. The hardware is amazing as said, and it's the perfect size and screen is huge for such a small phone. E.g. it has the highest screen to body ratio... beating iPhone X and Galaxy S8/Note 8. - And most importantly, it's not a Samsung or Apple where everyone has one - from the millionaire driving a Ferrari to the homeless guy on the street. - After you make so much effort tweaking it, it makes the phone feel closer to you lol. Also after the latest perf fixes from Essential, stock Android already feels faster and more crisp than my S8+.",

                "review_text": "The reviews were a little daunting at first. But after seeing a promising phone with no bloatware, and specs like this with a $500 pricetag I dug deeper. Most people were complaining about the camera/software which I have to say is now very smooth after the updates. The guy made android, you know he'll squash the bugs! I was upset with the camera, even with the updates I'll be honest. But with the latest releases as of writing (12/28/2017) it is the best pic quality you can get from a 13MP camera that I've witnessed and I'm extremely relieved. This phone is so smooth and for $500 I was relieved to get away from the bloated s6 that was starting to slow down to unbearable speeds. This phone feels so smooth and slick I was inclined to download a few games and I have to say if you like gaming on your mobile then this cant be beat for the price, only matched at best. I am big into encryption and security and I wanted the bloatware gone for less points of attack, and more room for active apps such as VPN. Anyways before the most recent camera polish this phone gets a 4/5. I'm happy to say it's a 5/5 now and if you're on the fence you will not regret it.",

For you average picture taker, which I am, I don't notice a difference between the camera on this phone and any other phone I've tried. The issue is non-existent for me. The display looks great and the phone is incredibly fast and responsive. I'm using Project Fi with this phone and do have an issue with MMS messages, but changing my default texting app to Hangouts resolved the issue for me (and isn't an issue with the phone itself from my understanding). I'm thrilled with the 128GB of storage, and the USB Type-C. I was moving from a Nexus 5x, briefly tried out the Moto E4, and was looking at getting a flagship phone such as a Pixel or Pixel 2, or Samsung Galaxy or Note, but I am glad that I went with the Essential Phone instead.",

                "review_text": "Firstly, I came to the Essential from the Nexus 6P, which was a good phone, but it's battery couldn't really keep up, and after experiencing too many of the common early shutdowns, Google allowed me to return it for a full refund after over two years of owning it. My choice for a new phone was between the Pixel 2, the Essential, and the OP5T. I chose the Essential, since the Pixel 2 was too expensive for me (even more so in Germany), and OnePlus couldn't win me with their sometimes shady stuff going on and I also didn't like the design as much. Thus I imported the Essential PH-1 to Germany, and I so far I've been very happy with it. I flashed the Oreo beta onto it, and the performance is generally pretty good, I couldn't reproduce most of the common issues with this phone. I had a lot of random reboots on beta 1 (and also some on beta 2), but those were caused by me rooting the device. A recent Magisk (root) update fixed all issues for me. I only experienced the touch lag/freeze up twice so far on beta 1, but each time a simple reboot fixed them. I'm going to talk about the rest of the phone in a small list: PROS: - Build quality and design: The titanium frame and the glossy ceramic back looks absolutely stunning. The phone also has a relatively high heft to it, which you either like or don't, I think it makes the phone feel really premium. - The screen: Yes, it's only a LCD, but it's great with perfect sharpness, great colors and good viewing angles. I think I actually prefer it over the AMOLED of my previous 6P. The form factor of the screen with the camera cutout it unique and looks nice in my opinion, and the cutout itself bothers a lot less than you might imagine. - Software: It's a completely stock Android, the dream of every pure Android software enthusiast. - Updates and support: Essential proved recently that they stand behind their product. Even though it had a rough start and a lot of software issues at the beginning, they showed their dedication through continuous software and camera updates, bi-weekly AMAs on Reddit, and a general openness to the community. NEUTRAL: - No headphone jack: not an issue for me, but might be for some? CONS: - Camera. Yep, I had to say it. No, it's not as bad as some reviews make it seem, as it got a lot of updates, but sadly it's not that great either, even if you use the Google Camera port from e.g. B-S-G. The colors just don't feel right, the HDR on my previous 6P was a lot more stunning, and especially in dark lighting there's a lot of noise. Doesn't mean that you can't get really good pictures though from time to time. Definitely note I'm coming from the Nexus 6P, which had an outstanding camera, so my perception might be flawed. I hope my rather lengthy review could help you in your decision.. so, all in all, even with the small issues I had, I can wholeheartedly give the PH-1 5 stars. Another PSA on replacement parts availability: Currently, Essential doesn't sell any replacement parts for it's phone, so GET A CASE! The phone is rather slippery on the back, and tends to slide off flat, slightly angled surfaces (like a tiling ledge in the bath room..). I heard though that Essential is pretty nice on replacing the whole phone if you pay a small sum.",

                "review_text": "For the price (especially after the price drop and Black Friday sale) this is such an amazing phone. The software is a little buggy and the native camera app, while continually improving, is mediocre, but the form factor and the feel of the phone are the best. I did have to return my first phone because I had Bluetooth problems (lost connection to smartwatch and Fitbit, reset all pairings, would randomly turn off) and even my second one has the Bluetooth randomly turn off, but I am in love with the physical feel of this phone. I previously had a Nexus 6p which ran great but the battery started wearing out. To hold them side by side, the screen on the PH1 is the same or bigger but the overall size is so much smaller than the 6p. For a female, this works so much better for me since the 6p didn't fit well in my pants pockets. Everyone I've shown the phone to, including my Apple-loving friends said how great the PH1 looked and felt. There's just something about the weight of it that it feels so great in your hand. They include a great charger and USB-C to headphone cable. The battery life on this seems to hold so much better than my 6p did and it charges super fast on the included charger. Despite my intermittent Bluetooth problems (which I hope get resolved with software updates) I am very satisfied with the phone. For half the cost, it has the same processor, RAM, and more standard storage (128 GB) than comparable Android flagship phones. The native camera app is the big drawback but besides the regular updates that have been improving the camera, it's easy to find instructions to load the Google camera app.",

I switched from a Nexus 5x and the transfer was super fast and easy. The o ly bad part is having to log back into your apps when you open them for the first time. The screen is huge but the phone is not, which is a super feature for me with smallish hands. The portrait mode has given me some beautiful photos of my daughter. My Nexus was running out of storage, so having massive storage feels really luxurious. The software problems that people had at the beginning are non-existent for me. The phone updated to Oreo on first update and has run perfectly. I'll update if I have problems. For now, 100% recommend!",

                "review_text": "I had been looking to move away from the Apple walled garden for some time and kept looking at what were quality alternatives to yet another new iPhone - I had looked at all the usual suspects and just felt that there was no reason to take the plunge. That is, until I came across the Essential PH-1, a genuinely premium phone made from ultra-premium materials that feels as if it will easily last 2 - 3 years. It is very fast due to the lack of any bloatware, the fingerprint reader is superb with no false positive or false negative occurrences and instant when you actually touch it properly to open your phone. I had been wanting to purchase the Stellar Gray version and as I am also in the UK, there was no official way to purchase this (or the other colourways) until this, the Halo Gray Amazon exclusive, appeared on my amazon.com account (not my amazon.co.uk account!). This is still not a UK supported phone as the charger is a US two prong affair but the charger supports 110-240V and an adaptor plug works fine to bridge-the-gap so that it can be charged. This leads me neatly into the battery life - I'm not a heavy user but it is giving me 3 full days between charges. For example, I went to bed the other night with 49% and woke up 7.5 hours later with 46%! I am now resorting to letting it discharge to about 15-20% then charging it for about an hour which brings it back to ~80%. I am truly impressed with the battery life and also the 'rapid charge' capability of the supplied charger brick! Much of the negative press over this phone has been due to its camera which, as at Oreo 8.1, is now more than just acceptable, it is actually quite good. I particularly like the 'Mono' mode for true black & white photo's which are beautifully sharp and atmospheric and which no other phone offers, to my knowledge. Also, if you want all the bells & whistles, just get the Google Camera App, although this is not quite as straightforward as you would want - visit xda-developers.com. To sum up, I am blown away with the premium feel of this phone, from the feel in the hand, through the superfast performance and specs, to the company ethos - your phone, no logos, no bloat/crippleware. I love this colourway, size and screen/size ratio and at $499 (\u00a3450 inc. import duties!) I believe that it represents phenomenal value compared to any other phone. (It blows away my wife's iPhone X which she hates despite 8 years of Apple products - she has even bought a Samsung Galaxy S9 plus to replace it!) The only negative has to be those people who are shipped a dud. I am sure that they exist and perhaps in numbers that are above average. But if you are buying via Amazon, just return it and I feel sure that your replacement will be every bit as good as mine is.... which is Absobloodylutely fantastic!",

                "review_text": "Great bloat-ware free OS. Stunning beauty! Work of art! Absolutely LOVE everything about this phone except for one major issue: The screen is very fragile! A phone should be able to withstand a \"gentle\" drop from under 2' without the screen cracking. I was on one knee bending over to look under my truck bumper and it slid out of my shirt pocket onto the pavement. This is my second PH-1. I loved the first one so much I bought another after sending it in on an insurance claim for a cracked screen! Thank goodness for insurance! I am not rough on phones, but I'm also not a big fan of hiding my phone inside a case either. I had Skinomi screen protectors on both, but it's the very edge of the glass at the corners that is delicate. I know I take my chances without a case but only sometimes. I only take off the case when I want to show it off. My last 2 phones were the Motorolas with shatterproof screens and they worked as advertised. Why aren't all screens shatterproof since the technology exists? Not only is the screen fragile, it is irreplaceable! Try a search on Amazon or eBay or the entire internet for a replacement screen and you will not find one anywhere. Contacted Essential and they informed that IT CAN NOT BE REPAIRED! Yes, you heard that right. Why hasn't some Chinese company mass-produced a knock-off replacement screen yet? I could be rich! Buy this phone if you don't care about the screen. It is an awesome phone otherwise. I just can't give it anything more than 4 stars. I wanted to give it 3, but decided one star for one flaw, however major, was fair.",

What really matters to me (other than the obvious price / performance / enough storage / connectivity): 1) Secure, clean, fast and up-to-date OS with timely security updates and firmware updates as needed. My previous phone (Honor 5X) was running Lineage OS. Essential OS meets my criteria but Lineage OS (with Pixel Launcher) is somewhat more rounded. Project treble (Oreo) looks promising, keep it up. 2) Easy to read display (approaching 50). Due to the high pixel density, some website font doesn\u2019t scale well (bad implementation on their part, a lower resolution screen would actually work better in this scenario). Proper font scaling across the border is a big deal as presbyopia ensue. To be clear: essential phone screen is high quality and the max (ideal) size I\u2019m willing to fit in my pocket. 3) A decent camera. Essential phone camera should be better for the price. My father Lumia 950XL (October 2015) is much better. HINT: Ideally Essential would release a quality camera accessory (28 -70 optical zoom) for $50.

The screen is gorgeous. It is apparently LCD and has a more warm feeling than OLED in my view. Text is crisp and being stock Android, it is able to easily be customized. As it is unlocked, it allows one to hotspot tether other devices as well. With the processor it has, it is very snappy. Games and videos load nearly instantly. Ingress is a game I play and is historically a slower to load game. I have never seen it load so fast. The makers website has basic instruction on transferring data, apps, contacts from your old phone to this one. As I am an android user, I had backed up my old phone to Google Drive and reloaded to this one. The only thing that did not transfer was my texts, but that may be my own issue. For iPhone users going to this phone, there are instructions to do that as well. essential.com/userguides I am one who has used Nokia, Blackberry, Motorola, and Samsung in the past and years ago found Android to be very good phone OS. My last phone before this was a Samsung Note 5. It too was unlocked, but had Samsung bloatware. This is a purist Android phone and needs to be seen on its own merits. It is elegant and simple and seeing nearly zero bezel is fantastic. I realize early reviews pointed out a few downsides and maybe they existed, but I see none now, at least in how I use a cell phone. In the very well boxed shipment, I received a somewhat short charge cord Type C on both sides. It has a charge block and a 3.5 adapter for headphones. One thing anyone should know is the optional accessories like the 360 camera and the prior mentioned 3.5 jack connect to the back of the phone by magnet. They just snap on. Pretty cool. Probably not the thing most would note as a thing to do, I took the phone this morning and stuck it to the refrigerator playing a video as I made coffee. To me an unexpected bonus. The magnet was strong enough to hold the phone to the door of the refrigerator but not be on there as if it were glued. My car has a metal mid console between the front seats and I was seeking a way to easily have my phone stay there. Voila.",

Yes I had to side load it, but that was a smooth and relatively quick process (about 15minutes), I'm sure Essential will be pushing the OTA soon. Reception is on par with other phones including iPhone which I carry for work along with my Essential phone. Battery life is good at approximately 28 hours of moderate mixed use (some streaming but no gaming). All features and apps have performed flawlessly since day one. Original review: The ONLY downside I've found is... This phone is very \"slippery\" and without a protective snap-case/shell the screen will crack if dropped! I cracked mine on the first day because I was too impatient to wait for the case to arrive. I ordered it the same day but the phone arrived first. I contacted Essential and they sent a replacement although it did cost me ( can't complain though...it was my mistake that caused the damage) For that reason I recommend buying insurance. Now for the good stuff... Updates are arriving like clock-work, It's still on android 7 although there is a beta of 8 available for the adventurous user. Best of all it is pure android...no bloat-ware istalled.... In my everyday use so far...this phone has been flawless. The battery life is great, but let me qualify that by saying I don't spend a lot of time watching video or playing games. The 360 degree camera is amazing even if you're only going to use it for speacial occasions. Scrolling is smooth as silk, touches are consistent even with the screen protector.

I have already dropped it a few times and I only noticed a small scratch on the back of the phone, and I only have one of those \"stickers\" on the back since it seems impossible to find a case that is sleek and safe at the same time. I waited for 4 years for something different to come to the market - thank you, Essential!",

Pros: price, build quality (ceramic and titanium), speed, size, front camera, button placement and feel, display quality/resolution, OS (stock android), and usability. (These are not all of the positives just some important ones) Cons: The only real cons with this device are that there is no headphone jack, waterproofing, and the dual lens camera is not the best. (Perhaps these 3 things just weren't essential when they designed the phone?) The only other thing keeping this review from being 5 stars is that there are virtually no screen protectors or cases for this phone. What are available are essentially all the same, and for someone like me who is used to otterbox cases it is rather frustrating. Other then those small cons this phone is absolutely excellent. Very fast, very sleak, and for this price point it is essentially unmatched. I highly recommend it.",

It should last 24 hours if you don't use it non stop. It also has a graph to show you how fast the battery drain and how soon will you be out of juice. 2. The speed, it is fast response, no slowing down. 3. It has everything inside including memory so it is a good value. 4. the screen is super big compare with the size of the phone 5. super fun with the 360 degree camera 6. Super fast recharge. Usually takes less than 1 hour. Maybe 1/2 hours if it is not fully depleted to recharge. Here comes the bad 1. Camera is about average. It takes worst picture than my S7 Galaxy 2. It is not water proof (This part is not as bad as the camera for me) 3. Having trouble connect to my computer through USB. (Not yet successful) 4. Using other charger with a USB C cable is extremely slow (Not a big concern to me since the battery last a whole day) 5. It is a little thicker than I expected but it feels like a solid build so it can take on scratch and dropping. 6. The phone locks up on me during my first week for a few times. Since then, it has stabilized. I just don't know how to reset the phone until I did some research. (If this happen to you, press the vol up button and the power button together and wait for 5 sec)",

From what I can tell it takes great pictures now. The hardware is second to none and very high quality. The software is practically stock Android. Very impressed with the build and no bloat software implementation. I was little nervous purchasing this based on the initial so-so reviews (mainly due to the camera), but I'm very happy with this phone after using it for a few days. It's an excellent deal at this discounted price point. Update 12/14/17: This phone received another camera update yesterday. I believe that's 4 or 5 camera updates since I've owned this phone since late November. The company is committed to fixing whatever camera problem the phone had. Takes great pictures. At this price point and with all the updates, this phone deserves another look by all the initial reviewers of this phone. The software has been stable for me. It's a great phone. Getting 128GB for $499 is a great deal compared to the competition.",

I recommend this phone without reservation to anyone looking for an unlocked, affordable, high quality smartphone. At $400, you get more than you pay for with the Essential. This is an awesome phone! I jumped ship after using iPhones for the past 8 years. I have a MacBook and iPad Pro and now this. I'm an early adopter and did not find the switch to Android at all challenging. Make sure to turn off your iMessages before setting up your Android. I'm missing some of my texts but they are on my computer. The awesome: This phone is so much faster and more responsive than my iPhone 7. Using Chromecast with Android means you can cast nearly anything including Prime music, etc. This isn't possible from Apple. So it now feels like I'm getting my money worth from Prime membership, Spotify and more. The phone quickly updated to Oreo 8.1. The battery is amazing and charges so fast. There is a lot of snarking about the camera. I'm not a photographer but appreciate quality design. The camera feels responsive and snappy. The photos are much better than my iPhone 7. Maybe not iPhoneX or Pixel 2 camera but really great for my needs. The phone design is really cool. My iPhone 7 had rounded edges and was slippery. The Essential fits well in my hand with the square design. The fingerprint unlock works all the time. I have average hands and this phone does not feel like a phablet. Just the right size. The LCD screen has gotten some flack but it's so much better than my iPhone 7 that I have no complaints. The screen has an auto brightness function that is really nice on my eyes. Areas for Improvement: The speaker is ok. Could be better but I usually use headphones or a speaker. There are some reports of screen lag and this is true for me. It's not terrible but occasionally slower than the pace I'm going. I got the Halo Grey to avoid the fingerprint issue. To do over I'd get the white. Within 24 hours the back of my phone is stained from the oil on my hand. (I don't have sweaty or greasy hands). This makes the phone look a little ... gross. The SIM card slot hole is next to the mic hole. That was a bad design choice. Just make sure you put the SIM key in the right hole.",

An uncluttered phone has to be experienced; once you've enjoyed a device without the garbage, you can't go back. The screen is responsive, and the use of space on the screen is efficient. It allows users to set up different accounts with different apps on the screens, so you can keep business separate from personal accpunts, etc. Switching between them takes getting used to, but it's simple. In hope Essential keeps coming out with these lean, gorgeous technological works of art.",

Reception is great, same reception quality as our previous phones which never had any problems. Had NO problem taking micro sim cards out and switch to new phones. Google transferred EVERYTHING over to our new phones from old phones, and we even were able to update to Oreo 8.1, all within 10 minutes! Phone is very quick, screen is bright, no rolling lag and camera works fine! Love the edge to edge screen and wife even felt the Essential screens were even clearer then previous. The display is approx the same size as our previous phones but the overall phone dimensions are smaller, making it better for handling. We have more memory left over in the Essential Phone (128 Gig) and without a Micro SD card, the phone appears faster than our Moto's with 64 Gig Micro SD cards. Instead of paying almost $1000 for the latest phone with a Snapdragon 845, I get 2 phones that \"I feel\" is just as fast for the same price of 1 with Snapdragon 835 on the Essential Phone, which we consider very fast! I read ALL the reviews but so far, we have been pleasantly surprised and incurred none of the problems others may speak of! If things change, I'll do an update.",

I found holding the down volume and power buttons took me to the boot loader screen which allowed me to attempt a reboot, shutdown, or reset. I tried rebooting and resetting and neither worked, it would keep boot looping. Finally I shutdown and just as I ordered my return slip about an hour later I tried powering back on and it worked again. Within 10 minutes of being on though it started to do it again. I basically spent a solid weekend having to shutdown, wait, and power on just to get texts. It's very disappointing, I really liked this phone, there's really nothing else like it. I found that this has happened to several people on forums and I sent an email to Essential who basically told me to do what I did above, but it still would randomly shutdown and boot loop. I guess I'll go try the OnePlus. I've been looking for a replacement for my iPhone 6s. I've previously owned several different phones including a Blackberry Priv, iPhone SE, LG G4, LG G3, LG G2, Galaxy S6, several Blu models, Motorolas, etc.. Compared to all of those, this phone is a step above in nearly all aspects. If you're looking at this phone you've probably already looked up some specs so I won't bore you with those, bottom line, it has nearly the highest specs of high end phones in CPU, memory, etc.. Physically, this phone is smooth. It has a glassy feel all around, it is heavy and sturdy, though it seems like a drop would crack the front and back, I don't know that that's true though. The company's site has a demonstration showing how sturdy the phone is, especially against scuffs (titanium), not sure about cracks. It looks very modern and simple. The finish is prone to fingerprints and smudging, especially the back, but honestly, who cares. Performance is very good. The phone is snappy, no hang ups, which is why I left Android for a bit after having the Blackberry Priv. Its wireless performance is some of the fastest I've seen, when I download an app it takes a mere second or two to download 50mb, which none of my phones were ever able to do. So far the only gripes I have with the phone is the finger print reader's lack of accuracy, sometimes it won't read my fingerprint correctly after several tries. It happens rarely, but it's still annoying. The other gripe is the lack of cases. I've only seen a few on Amazon and no mention of accessories like that on the Essential website. If you're looking for a high end phone for under $500, this is about as good as it gets. I'm very happy with the phone, it is performing better than expected.",

Still makes a 5 Star phone. So lets start with the obvious this is not a big box company phone, Samsung, LG, or Motorola. This phone is from a Small company Essential, a startup company who has released there very first phone, if you have not done any research on the company i would strongly recommend poking around there site and doing some research before buying this product. The short of it is this phone with plagued with issues after first release, making the original price tag on this phone almost unbearable due to the issues. But now, they have fixed most the issues are still developing and making the camera better with every update, they even had February, security patch updated to phone before the Google Pixel, released there update talk about quick. Down side to this phone as of Feb 18' They still having issues with T-mobile LTE apparently, from what i hear i have used it on both Verizon and ATT, Verizon they couldn't validate my IMEI, so i could only use it on the LTE network, however this is a hit or miss apparently, my father was able to activate his in store and works flawlessly. The camera is still arguably sub par, in low light still but they are still actively developing and trying to improve it. Upsides to this phone, it is just as powerful as a $1000 dollar phone at half the cost. Has all the features you really need or are Essential. 128gb Storage standard is fantastic and i don't think achievable in a new 500 dollar phone otherwise. The phone its self is just a beautiful phone from the edge to edge display to the ceramic back plate it is made with premium materials and it shows, I have gotten numerous compliments on just the way the phone looks. Software is quick and snappy, and plain. No carrier applications on this phone so its only the applications i want on this phone. So yes at this price it is a no brainier, i would buy it again. just keep in mind this is Essentials first phone and it may not be as smooth as a pixel but it is half the cost and still works well.",

I was in search of a phone not made by some random Chinese company that bought the name of some well known cell company, (Nokia, Blackberry) or just started there own name (One Plus, and many many more...) Frankly I wanted the iPhone of Android phones, without paying iPhone prices, or having to deal with IOS, all I really wanted was the build quality Apple use to have. Now having said that I have only had this phone for a week, so I have no idea if it really that great, and if I will get more then the typical 18 months out of it before it starts to act up and need replacement, however my first impression is strong and I really think it will. Essential was started by the co-founder of Android, and while it had some road bumps at first launch, I have had zero issues buying this phone in mid December, it has been very stable. Essential promises to keep this phone up to date with security patches for 3 years, and up to date with Android OS for 2 years. Currently I have the security patch for December '17, which it downloaded immediately when I turned on the phone, and I know Android 8.0 is coming very soon. I use to buy the Nexus phones for years, and really only for the up to date security and OS, but with the Essential phone I firmly believe that may be a thing of the past. I am hoping I will not have to buy a $700+ phone just to stay up to date. And one last thing I will touch in on, I had a Nexus 5X for a long time, liked it overall (Horrible battery life) but the one thing I did like was the form factor of a 5\" phone. I help the essential next to the 5X and they are near the exact same size, even though the essential has a 5.7\" screen size. The battery life is good overall, it has up to date high end specs, a beautiful screen, amazing build quality, you just cannot go wrong for under $500. Things I would change -I want a headphone port -Even though it has 128GB of storage (Amazing!) expandable storage wouldn't hurt. -Eliminate the bottom lip -Removable battery -Some OEM cases/screen protectors would be nice along with more 3rd party cases/screen protectors",

The Essential Phone, from a software perspective, fills the gap left in my heart by my beloved Shamu perfectly. I was able to port Google's (superior) camera app and Android 8.1 days after purchase. As far as looks go, it is a sharper looking phone than the glorious whale that was the Nexus 6. I think it looks better than the newest itouch or its brand newest Korean competitor. Even though this phone appears to be a slippery bar of soap, I actually haven't dropped it yet, a testament to how easy it is to hold onto. Ye ol' Nexus had bit the dust a dozen times by now. The screen. This thing is by far the easiest phone to see and use in direct sunlight. The tiny, tiny bezels are a revelation. It's sharp, the colors are true, and you can still see it in landscape mode if you wear polarized sunglasses. On to the elephant in the room, and no, I don't mean the Nexus 6 (God, what a phone that was), I mean the camera. Everyone needs to settle down about this. It works great. You'd think that people's lives depend on this camera going toe to toe with the world's highest priced DSLR, but let me assure you, no one's lives are at stake. The camera is fine. Perfect in fact. And you don't have an ugly camera bump! The stock \"essential\" camera app is a bit garbage, but that's easily remedied with a quick search of the inter-webs. Seriously now, at this price, you can't go wrong. It's nearly half as expensive as the newest phone by the Apple or the Samsung or even the Google (dirty traitors for killing the Nexus family) and I'll guarantee it's more bang for your buck. I'm now a loyal Essential customer. Have I mentioned how much I miss my Nexus 6?",

No device is indestructable and the Essential is certainly not an exception. The vast majority of negative reviews for this product were rage-posted immediately after a clumsy drop onto a hard surface caused an uncased, unprotected device's screen to crack (as screens do). Grab one of several cases here on Amazon and protect your investment; this phone should provide years of service with just a minimum of care. However, I don't recommend this device if you are incredibly accident-prone or frequently clumsy, and insist on using it without some form of damage protection. For the rest of us, this device delivers outstanding value and a refreshing break from the mundane, overbranded crop from the usual smartphone manufacturers.",

In general I swap phones every 10 months to a year. So I have had quite a few of them. I have seen many other video reviews and articles saying that the camera is bad on this phone. I think what people mean to say is the default camera app is bad. It is laggy but one update has been released since I have had the phone and it did improve it some. If you use the stock google camera app or probably any other camera app the pictures are great. I used my google pixel as a basis for comparison and I cant tell the which is which. Aside from the camera app everything else is great and it reminds me of the Nexus line of phones. In short, I love it.",

Amazing screen, the OS is CLEAN to an extreme, very very responsive, I have installed the official Oreo beta and its very stable.

You don't need a $1k phone, the specs are equal or a cut above, the style is modern tech minimalist, and the user experience is almost flawless. You have to hold this phone to applicate it. But, I wish there were more options for screen protectors and cases, the phone feels great in the had but very slippery and v2 needs AMOLED.",

                "review_text": "* Update * about a month later. Original review stays consistent. However there are a few quirk's that are problems. For one, periodically the messaging app crashes. I'm not sure if it's on Google's side or Essentials. But it shouldn't happen. The camera, absolutely terrible performance in low light. I missed a few moments just because of focus issues and the phone actually taking the picture. My kids would gather for a picture and I stood there so long trying to take the picture, that my kids thought I actually did. I was in a lit room but the camera just couldn't focus. Another instance is actually in very light situations. With full sun, the exposure is absolutely dark. I will add a picture to help explain. Colors were washed out and basically looking bland. Normal light situations with the camera is definitely acceptable. Infact pretty good with editing. I will add a picture with a editing from Snapseed. One excellent aspect that was impressive was that updates were on time and constant. I believe in a month I received two camera updates and a Oreo 8.1 security update. Well done. I just can't get over the camera. It's very important to me and I need something that clicks excellent photos and video. I'm not changing the 4 star review, I think the essential phone works, it's just not up to par. I plan on keeping it for a backup or for my kids to play games on or awaiting camera updates. I'm going back to iPhone 8 just on the camera and usable aspect. Im not a fanboy of either platforms, I simply want a phone that just works and does what it's supposed to do. Here is my original review. * The essential is enjoyable and frustrating at the same time. First off the premium feel and materials used are top notch. I love using this phone in my hand. It just feels like $. I take the phone case off at home it feels that good. Speaking of cases, there are some out there but nothing to actually enhance the premium feel of the phone itself. As far as screen protector, I haven't found one yet that actually sticks on the entire screen. (the ends are curved slightly). This is not Essentials fault by any means, I'm just saying what support is out there. It has a mono speaker. Sounds just fine(bass is slightly lacking) but this day and age it really should be stereo speakers. Speaker is loud. The screen is very sharp and bright. The camera notch it doesn't bother me one bit. The stock Android is great, it does everything I need it to do. The phone operates smoothly. I'm not really a gamer, just light games so I can't comment on graphical performance. Bluetooth works just fine, if I was to say the distance from say Bluetooth speaker is fairly a short distance before it starts to garble out of range. Calls sound clear and loud. Now the camera- I actually purchased the ph-1 when it was first released. I sold it the next day. The camera was absolutely terrible. However I really like phones that are different so I figured give it another shot with the price drop. I heard there were many camera updates so here we are. Camera is MUCH better in performance. Still not the greatest but definitely usable. It Excells in landscape photos. Sports terrible due to moving subjects, and night shots are iffy at best. However I like to support smaller companies and I'm hoping Andy Rubin will support us in return. Battery life is decent, definitely better than my iPhone 8 as far as lasting longer. I have only owned this phone for a couple days, but I will update my review if anything changes. One more thought, the ph-1 really \"could\" be one of the best phones made today, just needs some TLC and more updates. Looking forward to the next iteration. The halo grey by the way has a nice matte finish on the back. Much better than the glossy finish for fingerprints and smudges. The lack of Headphone jack really doesn't bother me at all. Can get Bluetooth earphones or use the included adapter. As long as this phone doesn't break or hardware failure. It will be my main phone to use.",

Seriously the best value you can find. This baby is so well built and it looks amazing. My friends freaked when I told them I bought with a 360 camera for only $550. The early reviews mean zilch now. When you get your phone let it do all its updates. Mine just updated to Oreo 8.1 last week and it operates flawlessly. I'm on ATT, so can't vouch for other carriers but I have no reception issues. This phone is fast and pure Android goodness. And the camera? It's great! No issues with delay or color. The folks at Essential have done a great job at addressing the early release issues. I mean, look for yourself at these pics taken with the native camera app. Do you see anything wrong? No! It takes incredible shots. If you are on ATT and shopping for an unlocked phone that is truly great, look no further than the Essential PH 1. Nuff said.",

                "review_text": "Prior to my purchase, there were three major complaints I observed while researching this phone. None of these have affected me after a few months of use. 1. \"It has a notch in the display.\" You're looking at the glass half empty. This phone is significantly smaller and lighter than my iPhone 8+ yet it has a much larger display. The notch isn't taking away from the screen, rather the screen space on each side of the notch is additional. If you want a phone with a smaller screen to body ratio, there are plenty of options with large bezels. 2. \"No headphone jack.\" Again, there are always tradeoffs in life. This is a full screen phone. Like the iPhone X, there's just not enough space for a 3.5mm headphone jack. But guess what, Bluetooth tech has gotten very good. So has the battery life of very affordable Bluetooth headphones. The best part? No cords! Adapt. Additionally, it comes with a 3.5mm to usb C adapter for your beloved wired headphones so there's really no argument here. 3. \"No sd card slot/expandable storage.\" This puppy comes with 128gb of onboard storage. Need to store your entire terrabite of photos and mp3s with you at all times? I sincerely get that. Personally, I live in the cloud for photos and music. Many people are unaware that streaming services allow you to move songs, albums, and playlists back and forth to local storage. For this purpose, 128gb seems more than adequate. The Essential Ph-1 is an amazing device that I would recommend to anyone with realistic expectations. If you want more than 128gb of storage and a headphone jack in lieu of a full screen display and nop notch build quality, there are many great options available for significantly more money.",

                "review_text": "I own 3 of these phones. The first I purchased from Best buy for myself to try it out before I committed to buying them for my family. I had originally started with a oneplus 5t to try out with T-Mobile. The phone was amazing, the coverage was not. My next logical move was the pixel 2 xl on vzw for a stock Android experience. Amazing camera, terrible hardware. It was bulky, washed out screen and just kind of ugly. Keep in mind I was coming off 4 consecutive Galaxy phones. I rolled the dice with the essential phone with a bag of mixed reviews. Pros: Build quality, nothing else like it on the market. Solid, hefty and really just sexy looking. Stock Android and unlocked bootloader. Use it stock, root it, use nougat, oreo, port in Google camera app, really do whatever you want. There is also a lot of support on xda forms for this phone. The screen although not oled, very crisp and blacks are not too washed out for led. I was impressed, especially coming from nothing but AMOLED screens for years. I even have an oled TV. The full face screen is also something you won't find anywhere else. Similar to the iPhone x but with just a small cutout for the front camera lenses and not a giant notch. Battery life is outstanding. 2 full days of use for me with a good mix of apps, streaming and email. Price. Paid 450 for my first one and 434 for the other two. Software updates from essential, I have had 4 build updates since my first purchase in November. 3 camera updates(it's getting almost good now) Cons: Camera needs more tlc. It's very good in good lighting, especially the portrait mode. It rivals the big names outside in daylight, however, the camera app is a bit slow and the pictures can get grainy in low light. Her needs work too. However the dedicated black and white sensor has taken some of the sharpest pictures I have ever seen on a cell phone. Thats really it. I hope essential keeps pushing forward with software support and building version 2. I will keep supporting this company as long as they listen to the consumer and continue improving their camera and software. Great phone! Also purchased 2 cases for my wife and son.",

                "review_text": "After having a U11 break (both sides after sliding out of my cup holder in my car and into the seat rail) within 6 months of purchase, I wanted something other than a glass backed phone--really, why would essentially (no pun intended) every phone company start putting glass on the back of a phone so that it can break on both sides? The Essential PH-1 uses a ceramic back that is more durable than glass. It is also some amazingly new material that is even more slippery than Teflon. The phone slips off of everything. I having lunch with a friend and the table wasn't perfectly level and it was literally sliding toward the edge. We could both see it moving! I waited about 20-30 seconds and stopped it from falling off of the table but had to block it with my wallet. Fast forward to nearly two whole months of ownership and the thing fell out of my pocket while I was sitting at my desk and shattered the screen when it hit the floor--from a whole 17\" off the ceramic tiles. I do like the finger reader on the back and the size. I do like the stripped down 7.1 interface but c'mon, you have exactly ONE LEGACY PHONE to support and 8.0 has been out for months\u2014I\u2019m not interested in the beta version that has been on their website for a dozen weeks. I will say that the guys gave me a replacement for a couple of hundred dollars and that was really cool of them. That\u2019s 5 star service right there! The hardware could stand to be better though. I think the biggest issue with the screen is that it sticks about 0.015\u201d of an inch above the titanium band that goes around the perimeter. It has a nice radius that makes the glass look really nice as it blends into the titanium but if it hits on the corner or on the screen--it shatters. it\u2019s also infinitely thin on the edge as it meets the titanium frame and I'm sure that doesn't help maintain an intact screen. Hopefully we\u2019ll see an improvement from these guys with the PH-2. I suppose most folks use a case but I refuse to do that. Let\u2019s just go back to ugly plastic phones if we\u2019re going to need a case huh? I REALLY wanted to love this phone and I do really appreciate the customer support. The U11 guys never responded when I tried to get it fixed. Essential was super helpful right away! That alone is reason to try them again and if they get the hardware right I certainly will. I'm between 2 and 3 stars on this guy: minus 1 for software and minus 2 for hardware but the support was outstanding and I'm going to give this a solid 3. I'm looking forward to a PH-2 review of 5 starts!",

I do not regret it. The phone has the fingerprint reader in an ideal spot and it is also fast and accurate. Not something I could say for the oneplus 5. It's fingerprint reader was in an odd spot, probably why they moved it to the back for the 5T. Another great point about this phone is if you do not want all the branding other phones have this phone has none. It also supports sprint and verizon networks not just GSM. Alot of people will complain about the camera on this phone but It takes pretty good photos for me. (Keep in mind I am not a photographer so I could care less what the pictures i take look like as long as I can make out what I was aiming at.) Only has 4GB of system ram but that is plenty for android now a days anyways, My oneplus 5 had 8GB but i seriously doubt that really made a difference in performance anyways. Doesn't feel like it did since this phone is just as fast from what I have seen. With the Oreo 8.1 release coming up this phone should only get better. If you want a no frills phone that runs like a flagship phone then I would highly recommend you get this phone. If you choose the moon black keep in mind that phone will be a fingerprint magnet. The white one the fingerprints don't show up as much on. And the gray version that is an amazon exclusive with alexa built right in is a matte finish. So go for that one if you don't want fingerprints on the phone.",

Did not think any of the more expensive devices could ever do a better job with the items I use a phone for than the Nexus. However, the Essential PH-1 is a real deal. Just a tad slimmer that my Nexus, which is great and easier to hold. It updated very quick and fast, and I have not had any of the issues so far that many have complained about. Glad to have made this choice. The 360 camera works flawlessly, and Essential has done a great job in perfecting the external device attachment feature using a magnetic snap on. Added a clear TPU case for a better grip and a bit of protection. Update: I had to return the Essential PH-1 because the SIM card reader stopped working. I spent several hours with the AT&T store, new sim card and all. Then many phone calls and a lengthly e-chat with Essential customer service to no avail. I really liked this phone but was not comfortable with trying another one. Also, which was an error on my part, I returned the 360 degree camera in the same package with the cell phone not realizing it should be a separate return, and Amazon did not acknowledge the receipt of the additional accessory. Could not find any answers as to why phone did not see any SIM card. Is it a software or Hardware problem? I am now back to using my old reliable favorite Nexus 6 until whenever.",

It's not Pixel 2 quality all the time but in most cases, it holds it's own when pitted against the pixel 2 and iphone X cameras. It has a mono mode which is best in class and cannot be replicated on other flagships. And yes, there's the 360 camera which is fun accessory to use this with.

I have an Iphone for my work phone and have not ever considered getting an android again. Was very hesitant because of reviews but boy should you not hesitate! I got a used one from Amazon for $345 and it had barely a scratch on it. The durability and craftsmanship on this phone is amazing! Side note, this phone does not work on US Cellular. I was going to use it to replace my work phone but they would not accept it as the phone is not on their List of \"Unlocked Phones.\" No worries, decided to jump on my girlfriends Verizon plan and finally have my own personal phone. Can gladly put the work phone down and use this one when at home. People complain about the camera but really it seems to work just fine for me.

I'd say it was no worse in terms of app crashes etc... than my original Pixel XL that had been updated to Oreo. The camera also isn't as bad as the professional reviews make out. I have installed the Pixel Camera apk from XDA and tend to use that. The camera is fine for what I need it for. The screen is good, not OLED, but at least it's not plague by the burning in problem that's affecting the Pixel 2 XL. Battery life is excellent. Android Pay and NFC works, although not as well as it did on my Pixel. Sometimes it needs another tap on the reader. For the price you really can't go wrong. I live in the UK and paid the import duty to have it shipped over and still, it was ridiculously cheap compared to other flagship phones. I would recommend it to anyone who likes pure/stock Android and doesn't like the look of the new Pixel 2. And it looks really, really, good! I constantly have people asking me what phone I have! It's what the Pixel 2 should have looked like, not some ugly Samsung/LG crossbreed! It looks and feels classy like Apple products. It's just a shame that the launch wasn't a very smooth experience for Essential! Hopefully they'll be releasing the PH-2 next year but who knows?!",

If you have your settings and apps backed up with google then everything begins to download automatically. If you have multiple email accounts you will need to set those up after the initial setup is complete. ***the major negative review about this phone had been the camera*** The phone immediately prompts you to do system updates, DO THEM! These updates tremendously helped the camera quality. This phone also has portrait mode which is nearly on par with Apples on the 7+ and newer phones. Not quite as good, but for half the price you should be satisfied. The build quality of this phone is excellent. I ordered a case, but I am tempted to go naked. The Titanium frame feel good and grippy in your hand. The ceramic back looks beautiful but smudges easily. I find I am constantly wiping it off. The Gorilla glass did scratch with my keys though, so investing in a quality screen protector would be worth it. This has a flat display, so tempered glass protectors should look great on this phone. One of the unique features of this model is the magnetic attachments for accessories. This is a really neat method but be careful. the phone is a magnet, I accidentally grabbed a pile of paper clips on my desk. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone to anyone already in the Android ecosystem. If you are an iPhone user looking for a more affordable option you should have a fairly short learning curve, give it a shot!",

                "review_text": "Essential is on to something with this first phone. Its design is unmatched. It feels so sturdy in the hand, Better feel than the S8 and I LOVED the way that phone felt. Unfortunately for as much as it gets right, It gets two things really....really wrong. The camera and the speaker. The camera on the essential phone is abysmal. It brings memories of the htc one m7. Great for the time but not ok today. Not even in the $500 price range. You have the oneplus 5 and the huawei honor 8 that give you a much better camera for the price. Pictures come out grainy and dynamic range is way off and leaves a lot to be desired. Next, and this may not be a big deal for everyone but it is for me, The speaker. It's really bad. Very tinny and oddly placed on the left side of the phone. I covered it SO many times with my pinky, by holding the phone upright to watch that I had to modify the way I held it. The screen is gorgeus and the colors are just right. The phone is just butter for everything. Extremely smooth and shouldn't slow down for years to come.... But with 2 huge shortcomings... I'm just not sure if it's a keeper.",

I know they had some issues with software at the beginning of the release but it's been very quick and smooth for me so I'm glad I waited. I'm coming from a Galaxy S6 which had an amazing camera for it's time two years ago and the pictures on this camera seem comparable, with more color accuracy. I did notice that pictures take a bit longer to take on the Essential Phone, which is a bit annoying, but the Essential developers have been constantly working to improve the camera and other parts of the software, and giving bi-weekly updates on reddit which I appreciate. I haven't installed the Android 8 Oreo beta and am planning on waiting until the official release. The battery life has been amazing compared to what I'm used to with the S6.",

                "review_text": "I am up grading my opinion of this phone, at first I was going to use it for a door stop but the budget wouldn't allow it. Lots of things to dislike, the Bluetooth is quirky, hard to pair with most of my stuff and it would drop out frequently. Another point is no headphone jack and it takes a specific one at that, I bought a two pack of headphone adapters and they didn't work, they didn't even cut the speaker off. The adapter that comes with it, works. Everything on the screen seemed so small compared to my previous one and the colors were kind of muted and the screen was slightly blurred. Those are the main things that bothered me I have worked through most of them, the screen problem was the pre-installed screen protector, took it off and color was good and the smallness was actually due to the high resolution. Now the good stuff is the large onboard memory 128gb, not having an expansion capability was not an issue for me. I found the camera to be ok and I'm going to give the 360 attachment camera a try. Another nice thing is that it charges fast! Less than an hour from o to 80% I think it's worth $ 400.and I'll be happy with it until its time for a new one.",

                "review_text": "I normally don't leave reviews but I felt compelled to do so for this phone. I have to say starting off, I switch phones constantly. I am coming from an iPhone 7, which is a great phone but I find iOS to be really boring. I was hesitant to buy this phone at the original price but since it dropped 200 off, I picked it up immediately. I had to see what Andy Rubin's phone was all about and I gotta say, I like it more than I thought I would. The design is striking and the feel in the hand is great although it is a bit slippery. I like heavy, bricky phones. I always thought that it feels more sturdy and premium and this is the heaviest phone I've held but once again, it feels great. I purchased the Pure White and it looks beautiful. The stock Android experience on this phone is what you would expect: Fast, responsive and almost zero lag. I say almost because the RAM Management on here isn't the greatest. If you have a lot of apps open, it WILL bog this thing down but not by any grand amount, just enough to notice. Aside from Essential own Camera app, this thing is bare. It has 31 apps installed on it and it is all Google apps and YouTube. It really is a blank slate. The battery is better than most Android phones I've owned with the exception of the battery king, The Moto Z Play. I'm getting around 5.5 to 6 hours of SOT. I use GPS, LTE and listen to music and YouTube constantly. I start my day around 8AM and by 6PM, I'd still have around 30% in the tank, very respectable. Charging the phone is also very fast. The USB C cable with the 27watt brick is no joke, that thing can charge the phone from 0 to 100% in about an hour and 20 minutes. The display is an LCD panel, which might turn some off and understandably so. It definitely doesn't get as bright or vibrant as a Samsung S7 or 8, but it is very serviceable. I keep the brightness around 50-75 and I've never had a problem seeing or using this phone outside. The fingerprint sensor is just OK. The process is not very smooth. I've had to scan my index finger multiple times for it to register. And once it did register, it would only recognize it 6/10 times that I would try to unlock it. This goes for both fingers. If you try to unlock it and it does not work multiple times, it will lock you out until you press the power button. It will not provide any haptic feedback after that point until you do press the power button and try again. Major headache but I can live with it for now. The audio experience is not anything amazing. If you are looking for HTC style of experience, look elsewhere. It's no where close. It gets loud, sure. But it's also tinny and a bit distorted. Even the small iPhone 7 has better speakers than this. Is it tolerable? Yes, but also remember tolerable has a negative connotation and take that how you want but I wouldn't be listening to music on this without some headphones or earphones. The camera is actually as bad as they say. In good lighting, it takes OK pictures. But when it's bad, it's terrible. The app is slow and really bare. But hey, I'm not much of a camera guy but I did own an S7 and that thing was a champ in the camera department. I'll wait for Essential to continue to push out updates for it's camera app and see how it improves but software can only do so much. I'm on T-Mobile and I get data and service anywhere that I had with my iPhone 7. In fact, I get LTE+ in some areas, which is Cat 6 and higher so I am happy to report both quality of calls and data usage are on point. There are a few things I need in a phone: battery life, a nice display, stock and close to stock Android, preformance and build quality. I didn't mention storage as this has 128GB of storage on it. 116GB of that is usable. I don't need wireless charging. I don't really even need waterproofing. It does have an IP54 rating, which is a light misting but I'm cool with that. The headphone jack, I suppose I've become accustomed to using Bluetooth, so that isn't a deal breaker for me. All in all, this phone has everything I need but I would like improvements to the camera and fingerprint scanner. Is it worth 499? I'd say so! It depends on what the person uses it for and what that person defines as essential. I would not pay other 500 for this. You could get better phones with all or most of the features if you were into it. But for the price point, it's a solid built phone, great battery life, more than adequate display and stock Android is always a great preformer with zero bloat. I'll hang on to it for a little bit and update after a month.",

                "review_text": "This phone works amazing. I find I have about three times the battery life from my last Android phone. It's definitely a barebones OS but that is probably why my battery life is so great. One downside is if you want a case for the phone and you want to use the 360 camera you have to take the case off every time to use the camera which is not a big deal. The picture quality is about the same as my last Android but it has a lot better depth of field due to the dual camera system on the back. I have not yet tried out the 360 camera but my guess is it will be just fine for my purposes. I did notice that if you get a different camera app the depth of field goes away but that's probably due to the default camera app is built specifically for this phone. The phone feels very well built. I have large hands and it is very comfortable. The screen is a lot better than my last phone the quality is very nice.",

Top notch screen, plenty bright, good colors. The camera cut out is non intrusive IMO. 3. Plenty fast with no noticeable lag. Stock android at play here. 4. Unlocked- can be used practically anywhere in the world. 5. 128GB is plenty for almost anything. 6. Has already received a few updates to the software to make it more user friendly. 7. The size to screen ration is unbeatable. This is a very very compact phone with a large 5.7 inch screen. The usability factor is immense. What Could be Better: 1. Maybe the camera could be slightly better but my expectations from a phone camera are limited to start with . 2. It does miss on certain features like the Headphone Jack and the IP rating. But when you take 200$ off the sticker price its easy to forget the omissions. Frankly, for the price it is being retailing right now, I see nothing barring the 5T that can match it.And visually this is a far superior product. Give this one a shot. You should not be disappointed.",

                "review_text": "Needed a new phone, and am on Verizon. Didn't really like the options available through the carrier, especially since those phones tend to come with extra manufacturer and carrier bloatware. Finding phones that Verizon does not carry in their product line that still work with Verizon is really difficult. I was interested in the OnePlus phones, but they still are not supported on Verizon. Since I was unwilling to switch carriers due to my great experience with Verizon's coverage, I looked elsewhere. I ran into the Essential brand and found that they officially are supported by Verizon. On top of that, they were offering a good discount on Amazon. I thought I'd try it out. To my surprise, it was extremely easy to activate on Verizon. It only required a simple Sim card switch. I had to disable an advanced calling feature to get the calls to work properly, but that was the only hiccup. Pros: Fast with great battery life Beautiful design that seems resistant to damage Charges pretty quickly and lasts all day with decent to heavy use Lots of storage space No bugs or incompatibility yet Fingerprint reader and buttons in a great location. Very ergonomic for people with smaller hands due to minimized bezel Cons: A little slippery. Doesn't sit on an inclined surface well. Can be solved with a case No expandable memory - though 128GB helps with that problem No built-in headphone jack - my headphones are bluetooth anyway. Camera a little slow - I think it's a software issue Slightly heavy when compared to what is out on the market now. I like it - makes it feel luxurious, and not cheap. Overall: Fantastic phone for the price, especially in the US market.",

                "review_text": "Took a risk on a small company based on the specs and curiosity. Have been using iPhones for years and concerned about the transition to Android / leaving the Apple ecosystem. In short, the experience with this phone, so far, has been almost flawless for my use patterns. In addition, it is just a lovely thing to hold, look at and use. What's best: - interface is smooth, deeply featured and an easy transition from Apple for me. In fact, I find Android more deeply featured (maybe to an unnecessary level, but the \"extra\" level of control does not bother me. So far, all the apps I have wanted (and it is not too many) are present and work very, very well. This phone is FAST. - the google ecosystem works very well. outlook works well, travel apps work well, and so on - no \"extras\" wasting space that I don't want to lose. - the display and form factor. Very well done. Much written about the \"notch\" at the top. Not an issue, that is well utilized. More important for me is the bottom of the phone, which is conveniently configured to permit easy 1 hand access to the launcher and the entire screen at the same time. Well thought out for a single hand pattern of use. Did not like the Samsung product in my hand nearly as much, or even the iPhone. Also, the display is gorgeous. - data / call quality on ATT, great - easy of activation on ATT, great - heft/feeling in hand - substantial, well built - best looking build quality I have yet seen. Looks/feels premium quality - like the more rectangular form with the radius corners on the screen - kudos to the industrial design team on this one - all the way around - google assistant - wow. superior to Siri. Did not expect that level of benefit to accrue that quickly - the 128GB and 4GB ram, standard - who will take the lower memory version of any Apple product? Nobody who has used one. - the extra $600 in my bank account - if this phone continues to perform as well as it has - I am gone from Apple, possibly forever. While I still have a risk with this small company, I feel that I have received a bargain. Heck, I could buy a OnePlus to back it up and still not be at the cost for iPhone X with the amount of memory I want. - company has been IMPRESSIVE with upgrade schedule - fingerprint reader, fast, well placed Like less - noticed only 1 bug that bothers me. The one I want fixed most of all is automatic bluetooth synching with my car. right now, I can get it synched with a verbal command to the google assistant. An extra step. The company was responsive within 24 hours explaining that the bug was being tracked and scheduled for the Oreo upgrade (in Jan?). - the camera app, which I don't use much - is less featured than other options. To be honest, that is not a feature I care much about on a phone. - the odd tricks that one has to go through to get one's stuff out of the Apple ecosystem. For example, getting rid of apple texting is a monumentally silly pain in the rear. That's all on Apple. I had to turn it off on my old \"sim-less\" phone. Then all my family friends still in Apple land could send me texts. Really ticked off my spouse, but I recognize that as ALL on Apple, and consider it a shady practice. Another reason to leave them behind. By the way, that has nothing to do with this phone - it is more about the transition. - the \"slickness\" of the phone - the ceramic side is so smooth it seems to actually floats on firm, smooth surfaces - this phone will slip off a slightly inclined notebook (but is very tough, I would venture it to be far more sturdy than the iPhone 8 and iPhone X!) - the limited number of cases available, but I was able to find one that is not too bad. Still, sorry to cover any part of this phone's design. Really very stunning Tricks I don't need/want - facial recognition - to whom does the benefit accrue with that one? You'll find out when Apple monetizes it. I wouldn't buy the X because it HAS that feature. - wireless charging - would take it if available, but haven't missed it much - submersion resistance level of IP Bottom line - this phone is a great bargain. Superior build, superior industrial design, superior specifications, excellent, clean operating system and installed apps, excellent cellular/wifi and virtually every band available. Again, the risk I still feel is with the small company - will they continue to come through as they have so far? I can't see the future, but I will say this - they have me as a customer right now, and have done nothing but delight me to this point.",

I know what some have said about the camera but I also know the phone is fast, sleek and a truly amazing and with the updates, the camera has gotten quite good. The fact there have been so many updates coming out to fix the camera, software and security patches made me confident in my purchase. I had looked at another phone (that is getting really rave reviews) and was just about to purchase it but after hearing the customer service from the company was awful, I decided not to. Another phone everyone is talking about this year, I heard the updates are sent very infrequently. I wanted a good quality product by a company that backs up what they put out. Was it perfect?

                "review_text": "I have the Essential phone now since a week and used it as my daily driver. The price has dropped $200 since I bought it, and since Amazon does not price match after shipping, I will have to return this phone in order to buy it at a better price. The overall look and feel of this phone is excellent. The combination of titanium and ceramic looks and feels great. I personally don\u2019t mind the slightly larger weight of the device. To me the phone somehow reassembles the older iPod\u2019s and I love it. Seeing that screen for the first time was amazing. The little font camera cutout (Cyclopes eye) is barely noticeable after a while and way smaller than the iPhone\u2019s X cutout. Stock android is a plus and the phone runs smooth, most of the time. I had to reset it once a day so far, as it would just stop working in the middle of a task (Various tasks). The position of the ear piece is a bit off, and you need to hold the phone in a slight angle to hear anything. I also find the call volume to be low, even if maxed out. This is especially annoying at louder places like an airport. Not a deal breaker, but just something I noticed. I connected my Samsung Galaxy Frontier S3 watch to the phone and generally it works pretty good (some of the features are not as good vs. having it connected to a Samsung phone). However, there seems to be an issue with the plugin as I quite often would receive a call, take it on the phone, but it was directed to the watch instead. This caused me quite some trouble. The battery life is great and I easily make it through a full day with normal use. Overall I have to say I am very impressed with Essentials first phone, and can recommend it. With the recent price drop it should be a strong contender for everyone who is looking for an Android phone that offers great specs at an affordable price.",

                "review_text": "I purchased this phone as a replacement for my Nexus 6; while I really liked the Nexus 6 and the \"pure\" Android experience, it was long in the tooth and due for an upgrade. Keep in mind that I only picked this up -after- the price reduction from the initial price so I am reviewing it with that price in mind. TL;DR: Pros: Display, size, storage, Android updates (supposedly - still no 8.0 OTA) Cons: No headphone jack, camera, slippery body, display (if you hate the notch) The display is eye catching and the feel in the hand is premium. It's smaller than the N6 but also heavier on account of the ceramic & titanium build. While the ceramic feels nice it's as slippery as ice. I don't mean this as an analogy, I found the coefficient of static friction in testing to be a little under 0.08. Ice on ice has a range of .02-.09. Teflon is 0.04 so this only slightly less slippery than Teflon. You need a case or this phone will slide on any surface at an angle of less than 4 degrees. I did find the camera cutout a bit odd at times and certain apps in fullscreen mode don't seem to know it's there. Others work fine. I prefer AMOLED to the LCD tech used in this phone but it's perfectly adequate if a bit duller than I'm used to. The camera is mediocre. I found performance spotty an occasionally worse than the N6. It does have some lag to it so be prepared to wait a second while it processes. Storage is great - I would prefer an SD slot but 128GB of default storage certain helps ease the pain; I don't really have to juggle anything on device storage and that includes keeping a full music library on board at all times. I absolutely hate the lack of headphone port. It's horribly anti-consumer and gives you yet another adapter to carry around compliments of the USB-C standard. I like the new standard, but there is absolutely no benefit to removing the headphone jack. I can't charge my phone while listening to music (without another dongle with a passthrough) and the USB-C to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter doesn't always work properly leading to situations where my phone randomly stops playing music or just starts playing over the phone speakers. On the whole, it's a decent phone for the money and is a decent replacement for my N6, though not perfect.",

Then I've had a handful of Nexus devices, along with most iterations of the Moto X. This is one of the best of them. Fantastic industrial design. Very prompt software updates; this is basically the only phone that isn't called a Nexus or Pixel guaranteed to receive Google's monthly software updates. On the negative side: the camera isn't good. My old Nexus 6P had a better camera. Some people report weak signal issues with T-Mobile, but, my particular unit has far better reception than my 6P did on T-Mo. YMMV. tl;dr - if you're looking for a Nexus/Pixel software experience but unwilling to shill out the money for a Pixel 2, the PH-1 is a pretty unbeatable value at the moment.",

Hopefully the color camera on the back catches up soon. Battery life is phenomenal. Went clubbing sat night and came back and forgot to plug into the charger.

                "review_text": "I purchase this phone in cyber Monday deal with 360 camera for just 399. Pros -great form factor, which is the only one I could find in flagship phone other than iphone, Easily to reach every corner of the screen in one hand. - frequent security update. I receive monthly updated after using this phone, which should be the only one other than pixel and Nexus phone Cons Not great battery life. Many comment said they have good battery life. But I just got a not so good battery life. Normally a got 3 to 3.5 screen on time, with Bluetooth and GPS on. I don't play any games , just normal surfing , Facebook , and messaging, so I really don't know why there are many user said they got more than 5 hour screen on time, It is really impossible for me use the phone in such a long time without charging. Not quite smooth indeed. When I open WhatsApp to people which I have many conversation before for many years, Its take quite a long time to open it, which I don't expect in flagship phone. While app opening is generally fast, screen rotation when changing orientation is not as instant as I expect in flagship phone. Fragile phone. A 2 feet drop make my screen crack. Yes, it is my fault, buy my previous moto x style drop much more times and much higher height and the screen is still intact. I believe the glasses is good quality , it may be j ust because I am unlucky or due to phone design. A case is need for this phone but it may compromise one handed usability. Those are major pros and cons I encountered in my 2 month usage. There are still some minor problems. Reception is acceptable but but in bad reception area it constantly have worse reception than my friend phones like Samsung or iphone. But I usually stay in good reception area so it is not a big problem for me. Photo quality is better than my expected. In Good lighting situation, image is bright and detail can be seen. Low light condition is not comparable to other flagship phone but it is what I expected. The worse part is the shutter response, after pressing the shutter, need to wait a few second to see the image which is disappointing. Oreo update is still beta. For a company which promise quick upgrade, there are some competitors already release Oreo upgrade. I would like to have a stable oreo upgrade as quick as possible. Verdict I really like small compact flagship phone, if the battery life can be improve by software upgrade , I will love this phone.",

                "review_text": "The headline says a lot of it, but I want to clearify that this phone is awesome. There are a lot of long critical reviews, that make you over think this purchase. A lot of people rate it 3 to 4 star range, but don't read into them too hard. My last phone was a Nexus 5x which was great, until it started to get phased out and lag uncontrollably with Oreo on it. After, I looked into getting a pixel, but did not want the same experience I had with my Nexus, because I thought it was more on Google's end with the software update issues. I also didn't want to drop a grand on a phone over the span of 2 years of monthly payments. After doing some research, I found the Essential phone, which had everything I wanted in a phone; -Great newly designed, sleek bezel -Big screen, small phone... I love this because I can hold it in my hand so comfortably and the screen is almost -Basically identical hardware to the pixel 2 -Stock, pure Android -Andy Rubin's awesome vision for a simple, futuristic company -Smooth operating system and seamless multitasking -Great camera (It's gotten way better, people are really over critical on this, its definitely better than my Nexus 5x) -A ton of storage (I'll never fill close to 128gb's of space) Yeah... I want to keep this short because I'm tired of all these tech nerds taking a dump on this phone. I've had it for about a month and sure, the camera might not be as good as some other phones, but its pretty darn close for me. If you're not an elitist photographer and want a phone from a company that wants the simplest, purest, freest android experience, then go with this phone. It's top notch, especially if you're considering a Pixel. I prefer this much more, especially because the screen and bezel is much nicer.",

                "review_text": "This phone has a ton of love/hate and divided opinions. Knowing this, and doing a lot of research before buying it - while fully intending to return it if I ran into the myriad issues reported - here is my experience so far. I have the newer revision white model and it came with stock 7.1.1 Android. Right out of the box I updated it to the last OTA offered, I think I took two total OTA updates with reboots. Being an experienced Nexus phone-haver and rooting/romming/tinkering with 6 different nexus phones and tablets, I also was excited to sideload the 8.0 Oreo beta 2. I unlocked the bootloader and reboot/auto wiped. Then I sideloaded the Oreo beta 2 factory image with no issue. I fully expected to be risking a \"beta\" experience with this phone due to its reputation, but after all updates and Oreo upgrade, I have not seen any of the issues people slam this phone for. The OS is very smooth, scrolling lag isn't a thing for me, the touch response is slightly less sensitive than my Nexus 6p which I just moved from but isn't a problem. Now the camera app... doesn't take the best quality pics. Coming into this phone after the devs have been updating the phone and app it isn't as bad as reviews from even a month ago, but compared to the nexus/pixel camera app it still isn't even close. But it does work now. Please note you have to update the camera app from the Play Store after upgrading the OS as well, make sure it is always updated as the devs work on it quite a bit. Battery life is great, I had about 3 hours of SOT with heavy use yesterday and after 14 hours still had 45% left. Way better than my N6p. Only weird things I've noticed are that the Amazon Shopping app and Prime Video apps will not work, they come up with the splash screen and then go black or never log in. I have to swipe them away from the recent screen. Not sure who's to blame there, app devs or Essential. Overall this phone is fast, I love having 128GB of storage, and all the apps I use except Amazon apps work as expected. I would recommend this phone without any problem. Feels great, looks amazing, and is performing well.",

When I got the phone in December I was thus anxious to see if the specific complaints were still present. I figured I would address a couple with my experience for anyone looking now. Buggy software: fixed. I watched videos with wonky page scrolling and apps closing, I have not encountered this at all. Everything is smooth and working as intended. My previous phone was a moto x pure which I was a big fan of and honestly that was a buggy phone in comparison. Sometimes it won't recognize the 360 camera at first and you have to take it off and put it back on, about 1 second. That's about it. Don't worry about your essential phone being buggy. Bad camera: fixed, largely. The camera takes great pictures in good lighting, and ok pictures in low light. This is standard for phones- some are a little better but I have used a lot of phones and let's be honest none really triumph in low light under normal circumstances. I would put essential within the margin of error of anything besides maybe the pixel/iPhone 8/x. Those were the 2 big complaints every publication had when reviewing the phone and they are non-issues. This is a really nice phone at a decent price.",

Clearly the best android ever, I wish other manufacturers 1) take pride in their devices as experienced with this phone b) listen to their customers complaints and dislikes. Its really not that hard. Build quality like no other i have had in many years. I have read so many reviews and watched so many videos and at this point i am surprised with the cons that other reviewers bring up (professional bloggers or regular users). Really ? give this phone 3 and 4 stars. Do we really think there is nothing wrong with other phones critical shortcomings that affect daily usage and infuriate the end user. I have had to live with critical and truly frustrating bugs with other manufacturers (let me not name them but you know who you are). Bugs that were never resolved year after year. At least the Essential team resolved most if not all of their outstanding issues a couple of months after release, pretty respectable if you ask me. Regarding features now... I see from other reviews that water proofing must be a super critical need I guess these days. Also like how we all take OLED for granted now and complaint for the choice of using LCD. Then when we get an OLED we complaint about image retention and inaccurate colors. Which is it ?? two different techs with known pros and cons. Essential's screen is nothing short of brilliant, bright, sharp with astonishing colors. Andy Rubin you are on a great path, keep on ...",

Screen :- The QHD screen is of good quality certainly not at par with Iphone X or Galaxy S8 + but definitely produces rich and vivid colors 3. Battery :- About an average and lasts a day of moderate to heavy usage and quick charger takes almost 60 mins to make it full 100 %. 4. Speed :- Fast processor for multi-tasking and games , excellent RAM management 5. Software :- Pure Android experience I have had received 3 Software Updates in less than a week so Software keeps getting improved. 6. Camera :- Average , I prefer LG G6 or V30 for Camera over essential Ph1 however if you expect a best camera experience then this phone may disappoint you . Overall I'm happy with my purchase and Iwith every software update this phone gets better , yes I do recommend this phone for its excellent premium build quality and processor speed and QHD screen .",

I was hesitant at first but the build quality and the pure Android OS make this the next best thing to a Pixel Phone. I'm not into comparing camera quality but it's way better than what I had before. So if you are looking for something to take great pictures than buy a Pixel 2 phone but if you just want a Smartphone with a pure Android and no bloatware (Alexa was the only bloatware installed because it's the exclusive Amazon color but you can uninstall her with no problem) than this is the phone your looking for. Very solid phone so you can tell it was built with quality in mind. I would buy their next phone if it comes priced under $500 again with the same specs as this phone. Oreo was waiting to be updated as soon as I powered up the phone. Speaker phone is fine and earpiece sound is great too. Battery life is great considering there was no bloatware on here which I personally think makes a difference in battery life. Any bad reviews about this phone are just being nit picky.",

I purchased one (in full price) and liked it so much when I got it to buy another for my partner (this time for the lower price). After using it though you start to notice the terrible touch experience. Sometimes it stops accepting touch gestures at all, and sometimes it decides that a specific spot is being tapped continuously (which would open a random app and invoke random commands on it, like uncontrollably deleting a bunch of emails !!!) The only way to \"fix\" it temporarily is to shut the screen off, wipe it, and reopen. Often a restart is required. One of the phones is running the Stock nougat and the other is on the official Oreo beta. Both present the same set of touchscreen related issues. And recently essential informed us poor users that 8.0 would not get an official GA build, and that the touch problems would maybe be solved in 8.1, which they are not even telling when the Beta for it would start. Very disappointing, I had high hopes for this phone to be a low-friction just-use-it phone.",

Some people complain about the camera, but I find it to be quite good. The camera software could use some improvement--more manual controls, for example--but portrait mode works well, and I find the color reproduction to be quite good. Some people complain about the camera, but I think it's a tempest in a teapot. If you *really* care about photography, you can't beat a DSLR or good mirrorless camera. Essential has made several camera improvements, and they say there are more to come. BTW, the 360-degree camera, which I was able to pick up in a great Cyber Monday package deal, works really well and it's very intuitive. To me, the biggest drawback to the Essential Phone is memory management. After keeping the phone on for a while (days rather than hours), performance degrades noticeably, and it also degrades when I have several memory-hog apps open simultaneously--although that problem is typically solved by simply closing the offending apps. Not a huge problem, but a little surprising considering the specs. Overall, it's a great value and worth the money.",

Usability (5/5) Camera (4.8/5) Battery(4.5/5) Let me start with the much maligned camera. Camera: Monochrome mode is the best I have seen on any phone camera. Portrait mode is really good now. Auto mode is good but has about a 0.3 second software lag in low light. The 360 camera is just brilliant. If you buy this phone get the 360 camera accessory - very portable (fits easily into jeans pocket with no discernible bulge) and easy to use. 360 camera software hangs about 5% of the time when I try to navigate to view the picture immediately after taking the picture. For the above mentioned auto mode low light lag and 360 software hang I give the camera 4.8. Having said this I would easily recommend this phone over iPhone/ Samsung note/ Google pixel to camera enthusiasts just for the mono and 360 camera. I have experimented with all 3 phones for their inbuilt camera capabilities. Full disclaimer -Google pixel/iPhone/ Samsung Note beats Essential camera in the Auto mode by a very small margin after all the recent updates. Design and Display - Best looking phone on the market in my view and display is right at the top there with the rest of them. The screen stretches across almost the entire face except for a small notch at the top and a thin bezel at the bottom. Battery - lasts easily for a full day under normal use. However heavy use leaves with little to spare at the end of the day. Interface - Clean, zero bloat and very slick. If I were to nitpick I wish gestures like double tap wake and gestures for volume changes / screenshot were available out of box. Last but not the least, the device is encrypted right from the start and since there is no bloatware and with 3 years of security updates, the phone is right at the top when it comes to security. At this price point, this is by far the best value for money as well. It's comparable to the top phones and beats them in a few areas too!!",

Better than my vaunted Nexus 6P that it is replacing. That phone performs much worse, has worse lag. It was a fine phone but certainly not perfect. The Essential Phone is still getting bad press and for what I am not sure. The few photos I have taken worked fine and I haven't had anything crash this first week of use. The performance is totally fine. Now on to the build quality. This phone is the best and most elegant phone I have owned period. Hands down. Same size screen as the Nexus 6P but in a much smaller overall package. The lack of bezel is a game changer and the notch is so small you don't even notice it. I appreciate the extra mile they went to achieve this. Way better than the huge cutout on the new iPhone. The only downside is this phone is hard to pick up and hold due to it being so slippery. I reluctantly ordered a slim case for it and it doesn't ad that much bulk but makes it way easier to pick up and hold. I love glass screen protectors and tried to order my favorite brand Skinomi. They didn't have one, only the film type protectors. I looked and purchased an off brand glass protector. I just got it and applied it and now I know why Skinomi didn't make glass protectors. The screen of the Essential phone is slightly curved for the last few millimeters and the outside ring of the glass protector doesn't stick. So fair warning, you have to use film protectors or go Au natural. I have already dropped this phone off the top of the shower (listening to a podcast) and it slid off from over 6' high and landed in the shower with the water hitting it directly. I quickly toweled it off and scrapped off the fiberglass from the shower from the corner of the phone and not a scratch on the phone. Do not try this at home.",

Fingerprint reader makes it very easy and convenient to unlock as I take the phone out of my pocket. The fast processor and large storage make this very responsive. I had seen a number of reviews indicating that the camera left a lot to be desired. My experience so far is that it is more than adequate for general photos and video. I have noticed that it introduces much less barrel effect than my previous phone when shooting closeups of text or other rectilinear material. Down side: it is taking me awhile to get used to the slippery ceramic back. The phone is a very holdable size but if you are used to depending on a stickier back surface, you may find this phone easier to drop. I had to create a small stand to hold the phone from sliding while reading the news during breakfast.",

                "review_text": "The Essential Phone is an excellent phone with a few compromises. Many tech reviews have not really done this phone justice. Let me explain why. Although the phone hardware is well designed, Essential did not include some ideal features like water-resistence, a headphone jack, and an OLED display. The truth is that these decisions were likely made to keep costs down and avoid supply hiccups. Although choosing an excellent IPS instead of an OLED display, may not seem ideal, when considering the Pixel 2 phone's OLED screen blue haze issue, and Apple's supply issue with their OLED displays, Essential made the obvious choice. During the initial rollout Essential had some hiccups in their quality control, but their real blunder was that they initially rushed the software without indicating that the phone was a \"work-in-progress\". This made the original price tag seem obscene and the phone unrefined. In addition, the camera software was a huge letdown. With the recent price adjustment and the frequent software updates, the PH-1 has become a smartphone package that is easily one of the best phone values today. It is now competitive with the Oneplus 5/5T rather than paling in comparison to the Pixel and iPhone, which are significantly more expensive. That said some folks seem to feel that the Oneplus 5T edges out the Essential PH-1 in a close race. One key thing to consider is Android Oreo. Although both phones will get Android 8, only the PH-1 will support Google's Project Treble which will allow for faster Android updates longer into the future. This means that the Oneplus may become unsupported and not get updates in the near future. The Essential PH-1 looks beautiful, feels well made and gets great reception. Although not number one in the camera, it takes pretty good photos. Unless you have unreasonable expectations, for the price this phone is a great deal. In my book, it is the best phone value going in 2017.",

                "review_text": "Everything on the user end is great. I hear it may not have been a while ago before a lot of updates but I find it a nice phone to look at and use. It's a fairly compact phone, as far as phones go these days. I appreciate that too as it makes good use of its size. However, I find it odd to call this the essential phone and not include a headphone jack or the option to expand memory with an SD card. What if my phone dies? An SD card makes that much less of an issue to deal with since you can backup to a little hard drive you can always pull out. Plus, it makes it so much easier for someone with a huge music library to transfer the music. I just move the card over...but with this, it's drag and drop of a huge file that takes almost an hour and sometimes not everything transfers properly and I never know why. Anyway, back to the lack of a headphone jack...I find it mostly upsetting because it should be more water proof than it is especially without a headphone jack. So to take that away and have it's IP rating lower than a lot of it's competition is frustrating. But it's ok. I never dunk my phone in water or risk that really happening. And most of my headphone use is Bluetooth but I do use a standard one sometimes. And there's always the adapter, I guess. Overall, a really great phone that stands out in the competition. I think it's totally worth the money and a lot of my quarrels with it are often things I would say about other high end phones too. I hope there is a sequel to this phone that makes it even better. I'll be keeping an eye out for that.",

                "review_text": "I decided to wait a couple weeks before doing a review. First a little background on my phone use ... through work and home I've used a Blackberry, several android phones, Windows phones, and the iPhone going back to the 3S. Since the Blackberry, I've always had an iphone for work. My personal phone has changed quite often until two years ago. At that time I gave up on the Windows phone due to app support and android due to lower app quality and general issues with battery and stability. Since that time I've been running two iphones. After IOS 11, I was very disappointing with the speed of my 6 plus. It would take forever to open an app, and it was having more app crashes than I liked. I didn't like any of the iphone options. The 8 was much of the same and I wasn't ready to pay $1k for the X. I decided I would see what improvements had been made in Android over the past two years. I really wanted a \"pure\" android experience, since the others I had tried were not. I loved the look and feel of the essential phone, and when they dropped the price it was a no brainier. First, I love the \"pure\" android experience. The operating system has been very stable and I'm having no battery issues. Standby battery drain is still slightly higher than the iphone, but it's much improved! Most of the android apps are also up to the quality of the IOS counterparts. The essential phone has been fantastic! I still love the quality feel of the phone and the large screen for such a small footprint. I'm not running a case or screen protector for the first time ever. It make me a little nervous, but so far it hasn't been an issue. I have no complaints about the camera. My wife and I were taking pictures at a dance for our daughter, and she preferred my pictures to the ones her mom took on her 7 plus. I'm sure the iphone X and Pixel are better, but I'm very satisfied. Battery life has been very good. I'm very happy with my purchase and think the phone is a steal for the current price.",

I would have probably waited for the S9 but I'm not a big fan of the curved edges. I'm not even sure how I came across this phone but I did a couple weeks of reading and research on it as well as the OnePlus 5t and thought what the heck I'd give it a shot. Fresh out of the box this is a beautiful phone! By far the best looking phone I have owned. I decided that before I ever activated it to go to the Essential developer site and download Oreo Beta and install it. It ran pretty good had a few small freezes and reboots and then they released Oreo Beta 8.1. Since taking that in an OTA update this phone has been the bomb! No more freezes or random reboots it just runs smoothly. I do notice that after many days of uptime battery life begins to wane so I'll do manual reboots ever 3 or days to keep it up. Which by the way can be 30 plus hours with lots of on screen time. I never tried the 5t so I can't really compare but I can say that I am 100% happy with this phone! It just feels like a super quality device and now runs great and camera work very well maybe not the best but really good. If you're looking for a mid priced quality phone give it a shot. I have also use it on both AT&T and verizon and it works great on both.",

From the father of Android himself: Andrew Ruben. Also most Unique is their branding: No Branding at all! To all those youtubers taking it down for the average camera... Well from my personal experience, it may not be the best, but it is definitely among the best. And those comparing it with one plus 5t... \"Pity you\" is all I can say. There are other reviewers who are honest on their review of the ph1 camera. I in fact decidied sacrificing on camera quality for its sturdy make, and super premium hardware and materials,watchong those misleading videos which declare the camera as mediocre, and some even saying total crap. Only after i lay my hands on the device did i discover that the camera is actually top notch and comparable to apple n samsung. Only place where i find it a bit,and i repeat, only a bit lagging is dark ambience- like really dark. The images become a bit noisy n grainy. Rest the camera is just awesome. Man the judderfree superfast performance, and top notch built quality and a superior (if not the best) at the price of mid budget phone make the Essential a must have. Mind you Apple is total glass. One fall... N you are done. Samsungs, i dont wanna talk even. Ugly as usual with mediocre feel n touch, and still containing bloatware. While if you have any doubts about the essential phone sturdiness, just check essential phone break test on youtube. Just check... You will be amazed. Thanks Amazon for super quick international delivery. N Thanks Andrew Ruben for the bery wonderful phone. It is Essential indeed. Never took so much pain, penning a review till now in my 10 years with Amazon. But this product just made me go ahead n write my heart out... It is that good.",

Maybe its my luck. Not worth sending it back I can deal with it..I need a phone..Still 5 stars the phone is amazing. Just minor cosmetic issues with chassis.. I just switched from the gigantic phablet Pixel 2 XL & I must say the Essential phone fits me alot better. The screen is 10x better than the Pixel 2 & 2 XL. The camera is a bit worse but I can hardly tell as I am not a photographer. This Essential phone camera is phenomenal. The speed on the Essential phone is almost identical to the 2 XL.

All I can offer is that it's a very definite improvement over a 2013 phone! Quality is just fine as far as I'm concerned. -Operational \"smoothness\": My experience with this phone has been perfectly smooth. Scrolling on webpages / apps / menus is all smooth. Responsiveness is good. One note: In developer options, there's a setting to turn off \"grip rejection\". DO THIS! Otherwise software creates a \"dead area\" for 5mm or so around the edge, which makes some controls and links untouchable. -Battery life: Easily 2 days of \"normal\" use. Never been below 30% after one day of very heavy use. This phone has seen a lot of early bad press, but at the current price and feature set, it's a fantastic deal.

Everything worked correctly for a few hours, but suddenly the audio from my headphones stopped. I have tried all of the methods I know of to fix strange problems like this. Restarting, a factory reset, developer options, etc. Nothing worked. The speakers on the phone still worked, but using the included adapter did not. I collected a large amount of information regarding the problem I was having and sent it to Essential to see if they could help me. I am not an expert, they should know more. They did not help me at all. They could not confirm if it was the adapter or the phone that was the source of the issue. They did not even try to, perhaps I had already exhausted all the options they would otherwise tell me to attempt. Instead they decided that a warranty replacement for the adapter was what they were going to do. Since I assumed that the adapter was the issue, and not the phone this seemed like a good solution. That is, until they found out I live in Canada. International mail is too difficult for them and they ceased communication and refused to help me in any capacity. So, be warned. Essential's products can be defective. If you have a problem and do not live in the US they will not help you. Imagine the frustration of being stuck with a broken device. Your money is better spent elsewhere. Fortunately Amazon was willing to offer me a credit, which is better than me having to pay to ship it back to them, or nothing.",

I have been a previous Apple guy and after the passing of Steve Jobs, I have made the transition to Android/Windows. Prior to this, I had a Samsung S7 edge. I love the OS. I like that it is simple. People are constantly impressed by the sleekness of the phone. The updates have improved this phone tremendously compared to the reviews I read. I have no complaints except a couple which I will list below. Cons: Low call volume. I usually have to put people on the speaker to hear them well. Occasionally, the Bluetooth will disconnect in my car. However, that could correspond to my car and not anything else. Pros: The design is amazing and I constantly get people asking about it. It has a good weight in your hands. Speakers are crazy loud. The screen has great contrast. The performance is great. I had an iPhone user mention how great the camera was. I am not sure if that's any consolation since those were a lot of the launch issues.",

                "review_text": "I was eyeing the Essential phone ever since it was announced. Now, after the price drop, it's almost a no-brainer. If you look at the hardware specifications alone, you don't do this phone justice. Sure, there is no heart-rate monitor, no iris scanner, no wireless charging, not even a headphone jack. It's not an OLED display, there is no optical image stabilization (OIS), no telephoto or wide-angle lens. But there is also no Bixby button, no pre-installed proprietary calendar / app store / file browser bloatware, no screwing around with basic android functionality. Not unlike the Pixel, Nexus, and old Moto phones under Google's control, the Essential PH-1 is about user experience. The Essential PH-1 looks not as sleek as some other flagships, but somehow you want to pick it up and interact with it. Why? It is not annoying. Essential gets more stuff right, and - more importantly - less stuff wrong than other companies. Here is what I mean: SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE It's pure Android with basically no modifications (just optimizations). Why is that important? Just three random examples: - Unlike other flagship phones, the Essential PH-1 listens to \"OK Google\" even if the screen is off and the phone is not connected to a charger. - The Essential PH-1 implements Google's \"Cast screen / audio\" feature without modifications like strange overlay bubbles. It just works as intended. - When abroad, you see a small R next to you mobile data icon to indicate that you are on roaming. There are no annoying pop-up message every 30 minutes or anything like that. HARDWARE EXPERIENCE Unlike some other flagship phones, this one get's the essentials right. Like microphones and fingerprint scanner: - The Essential PH-1 uses four microphones for audio input and noise cancellation. Cover whatever part of the phone with your hand / car mount / charging dock and voice commands / hands free calls will still work. - The Essential PH-1 hat an extremely fast, easy to reach fingerprint scanner that works reliably even with swipe gestures turned on. BUILD QUALITY Just wow. This is no fragile all-glass phone. The Essential PH-1 is really slim but feels substantially heavier / rigid than other phones its size: - Unbreakable / unscratchable ceramic back. This is no coated plastic or painted glass. It's colored ceramics which is harder than steal. - Titanium frame (unpainted) with buttons made of the same material. Much stronger than standard aluminum or steel frames. The plastic antenna lines and the trim (that protects your screen) are colored (not painted) and thus won't loose their color from wear and tear. CAMERA Very basic, but constant software updates by Essential bring more and more functionality. A portrait mode (background blur) was recently introduced and it works very good. The rest of the camera app is very basic with virtually no settings and limited manual controls: - Good user experience (for example there are no integrated half-baked editor and gallery but links from the camera app to the excellent Google Photos app editor and gallery). It lacks features like panorama mode or something like the AI post-processing on Pixel phones, but you can install the Google camera app with full HDR+ compatibility. Unfortunately only the stock camera app can use the monochrome sensor for enhanced low-light shots. I attached to pictures that compare the camera quality between the stock and the Google camera app. (December 2017 software, Android 7.1.1) - I always loved the Google camera panorama and photo sphere modes. But taking those pictures takes a lot of time and you look quite funny doing it. Other phones try to imitate these features (sometimes with horrible results / bad stitching). Essential on the other hand offers a 360 camera extension that not only produces a perfectly stitched 6080x3040 sphere but can also record 360 degree videos and even live stream to YouTube and Facebook VR. But you have to pay extra for that 360 camera. SECURITY AND UPDATES The current stable software (as of Dec 10) is Android 7.1.1 with security patch level from December 2017. This is really impressive. Essential published the December security update at the very same day as Google did for their Pixel 2 phones. No other company did this. And everything looks extremely promising for future updates - The Essential PH-1 has an open Android 8.0 beta test with detailed instructions for manual installation, covered under warranty. Reports say that the software experience is further improved even in the beta version. - The Essential PH-1 will get hardware abstraction layers (HALs) for much easier and faster updates (Project Treble). While all phones that are released with Android 8 or newer are required to implement Treble, phones updated to Android 8 can choose if they want to support it. Essential is one of only three companies that confirmed Treble support. All the big players will not add support to old phones. Again: Project Treble will make it much easier for manufacturers (and custom roms) to release Android updates for phones. It looks like Essential wants to provide software updates for the PH-1 for a long time. (Essentials released a statement saying that initially some HALs are \"Passthrough\" to relase Android 8.0 as soon as possible, but that over time more and more HALs will be reworked to full \"Binderized\" HALs.) As you see, I am impressed by the commitment of Essential. It's not the perfect phone. But it's close. And it's an amazing value after the recent price drop. MY MAJOR COMPLAINTS - no Daydream compatibility (Google's VR goggles) due to the LCD screen (you can root the phone and activate support manually) - no full waterproofing, no headphone jack, no OIS (absolutely OK for the price you pay) WHY I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS PHONE - gorgeous screen (great black levels and punchy colors even though it's not OLED) - great user experience and latest software / extremely fast updates",

Their support is also good but unfortunately you don't get any actions besides them being (responsive and nice) with their international customers for obvious reasons of Limited Warranty. In a nutshell I can say that I can't recommend this phone to anyone because it just dies after a couple of weeks of using it, LITERALLY! At least that's what happened to my unit. (the pic attached showing the screen while it's ON) Here's my detailed experience if you're interested: It all started in mid-Jan when I got my brand new EP from Amazon. It was all okay with some hiccups every now and then, I knew that before getting it but I believed in Essential team's frequent updates. The most things that frustrated me were random shutdowns, most of apps are not (yet) compatible with the notch, the slow response of Google Assistant and the shutter lag of the camera (though quality of photos taken were very good). Anyway, in mid-March my phone couldn't turn on the screen. Did a restart, hard reset, power off/on but the device didn't seem to respond nor reviving the screen. Phone seemed to be dead, screen was only able to illuminates blacks when turned on. I was getting accurate vibration feedback form the fingerprint scanner (long vibration for registered fingers/ two short ones for other fingers) and from power off/on. Contacted Essential to see if I can get it repaired, I received a polite and fast reply that they can't due to my location outside the US. Now I got my phone returned thanks to Amazon Support's understanding.",

The ceramic back is silky-smooth. That means no distracting textures when I hold it; but also that if you put the phone on a tilted surface, there is very little friction, and the phone will slide. The included USB-C charging cable has a braided cover and feels much tougher than normal charging cables. The camera is just fine. Yes, it could benefit from image stabilization and faster focus. Yes, there are better cameras and camera software; but media reports of poor quality are greatly exaggerated. After loading all the apps I could ever need, the phone still has 100 GB free for podcasts and taking pictures and video! The software experience (I'm on android 7.1.1) is very nice.

Operation is silky smooth and the screen is very clear with accurate colors. The camera produces very good photos, particularly in good light. There is no bloat and plenty of storage. If you are on the fence, don't hesitate. It's just as good as the other flagships without all the gimmicky fluff and at half the cost. Highly recommend!",

I really love the fact that I could easily put on a different version of Android, I'm looking at you Lineage, and even if I don't, I like the option. As for the camera. I'm coming from a Nextbit Robin, and I feel like the camera is just fine. The video at high resolution is just beautiful looking, but I don't really use the camera all that much. There is no audible click when you press the capture button, so I've found myself taking more than one of a picture not realizing that it's already been taken. The battery was one of the most important parts of the phone, I've not had a problem yet and end up between 30-40% at the end of the day if I don't charge it up.

I easily get through a whole day. 2. Screen and hardware is nothing shore of gorgeous. 3. Feels good and fits in my pocket well. 4. Coming from a locked Verizon phone, it's amazing to have had three system updates since I've owned this. Security concerns are addressed quickly and the camera issuse are being addressed. 5. The camera is actually pretty darn good. I feel like the mono mode captures the photo better. 6. I got the version that came with the 360 camera which is really cool for photos in that it captures the whole environment. However, where this really shines is in videos. I captured everything while the whole family sung happy birthday to my mother on her 60th. It was pretty awesome. The Not So Good: 1. I have experienced some crashes. They aren't too frequent but I'm glad the updates keep coming. 2. I'd have though the 4k 360 camerar would capture more detail. 3. I hope they continue to improve the camera. I wish the color (as opposed to mono view) was more crisp. Overall, I'm quite pleased with this purchase. The Essential team is working hard to continue to improve the experience and I hope they keep at it. Buying this with the camera included and at around a 400 price point was kind of a no brainer and I've continued to be happy about the experience.",

                "review_text": "This phone is probably one of the most underrated phones of 2017. I sell phones for a living so I have used everything from the S8, Note 8, iPhone X, and many more. There are many features packed into this powerhouse of a device. I love the simple Android experience I get with this phone. There is absolutely no bloatware you normally get with a phone that you get from a cell phone provider. I also love how the quality of the phone, I would go as far to say it is the best phone I have ever put in my hand. The device is very premium with the cermic back and titanium body. The phone does have some weight to it which I appreciate it feels solid and sturdy which is a plus. I don't want a phone I can feel like I can snap in half or a phone that will bend. This phone is currently running Android 7.1.1 with 8.0 in the works. I believe there is even a beta for it. The design is very modern and fits in with most flagships as a very minimal bezel is very in right now. The USB-C charging port is nice and up to date with other high end Android's. The USB-C is also a much more durable charging port vs the micro which end up wearing overtime due to prongs breaking or wearing out. The photo's from the camera are great quality. The snapdragon 835 is fast with plenty of ram on board it makes multi-tasking a breeze! I do appreciate the 128 GB of storage, it is more than enough for me. This phone is unlocked and works for any carrier which is a huge plus. It is a shame this phone isn't sold through my employer because I would sell this phone all day to customers. Why pay $700+ when you can get everything and more for half of the price!",

Happy to report the gray option stays cleaner! Awaiting the 8.1 beta to be pushed to my device but I am also happy to report that on 7.1.1 I am seeing zero issues with screen lag or the commonly reported latency issues. Camera also seems to produce some truly spectacular photos with decent lighting. However, low light photos get very grainy and the stock app has some serious shutter delay although that is reported to be better with the 8.1 beta. All in all it is an incredible device with a very premium feel and lightning fast performance. No more iPhone for me. The screen is incredible with deep blacks and vibrant colors.",

Does everything I want, and does it well. And I have never noticed the camera not being good, I have seen that in reviews, but I think it is great. By far the best phone I have ever owned or used. So then why the three stars? I have had it 3 months, just dropped it 4 feet onto a memory foam bathmat and it cracked the screen.. They market it as being tough. Made of stronger materials than other phones. They don't sell cases. There appears to only be like one aftermarket case even available. I had a screen protector on it, thank god, because otherwise my bathroom floor would be covered in little pieces of broken glass. And apparently it is pretty hard to get repairs or replacement parts, so wooo. Haven't had the opportunity to see yet, since this just happened, but so far I haven't found much info on places where I could get a screen. So I am not even sure if that's fixable. Didn't bother with warranty since I am not really a heavy phone user, I need the large harddrive for music and audio lessons, but my phone spends 90% of it's time safely in my pocket and I am only 5 feet tall anyways so how far am I really going to drop it, lol. The glass is rated to fall from my height without cracking",

However the software is very unpolished and unpredictable. I used this phone on Verizon for 3 short days almost immediately I had problems getting service. Then it finally gave up and said \"No Service\" a brief restart would fix this then it started happening all the time before I knew it I was restarting my phone 5+ times a day that's absolutely unacceptable. Then when it did get service it wouldn't let me text or call. And the worst part about the whole thing is Essential knew about this issue over 5 months ago. And says \"We will be rolling out an update to fix this soon\" I can't wait another year to get my phone to actually be a phone. Steer clear if you're using it on Verizon.",

                "review_text": "I really wanted to like this phone. It's got a solid feel to it, and looks really good. The screen is nice and bright. I liked how there is very little bezel around it, and the screen is all you really see. The phone is fast at processing and transitioning from one thing to the next. The battery life on the phone is incredible and I would get about a day and a half of use from it before needing to be charged. But I think that's about all the positives I can think of. So the major construction of the phone is titanium and ceramic. However, there is still a plastic bezel around the glass screen, and for whatever reason, a small portion of the plastic bezel broke. I cannot figure out why that little piece broke either. I did not drop the phone and it's only been in and out of my pocket or sitting on my desk at work. When making a phone call the earpiece is built into the very top of the phone, and if you didn't get it just right to your ear, you could barely hear the conversation. Plus the top of the phone is a little sharp, and trying to find the right spot on your ear can be ever so slightly painful as it scrapes your ear. While using the speaker phone, the speaker had a slight vibration to it that you could hear at certain times. I heard it often enough that it bothered me. The screen is marketed as a \"full screen\" which it is when you are just looking at the home screen, but as soon as you go into any app or webpage, the only visible part of screen is below the front facing camera, so your actual usable screen is smaller and not \"full screen\". The reception also seems to be really bad. I would drop calls, or have to walk outside my office to get any kind of reception. I switched phones, and the reception is much better now. I have returned this phone, and I hope that in the future it gets better, I may try it again. But for now, I picked up a Huawei Mate 9, and for the short time I have had it, I like that much more. But I will do a separate review for that later.",

Now, I don't know what's the issue behind that, but I had a replacement sent to me, after receiving the first one with the same problem. Please, address this issue, as it is really annoying. I found a way to work around that, just using a different Phone App from Play Store, but others may not be this chill about the issue. So far, that's about it. If battery life is something that matters for you the most regarding cell phones, this is a great option. I left home today around 7 am, now it's 8 pm, and the battery is still at 48%, which is really really good. Also, this phone is very fast. Camera is OK, haven't played with it a lot, but as a former nexus 6p user, I can say 6P is definitely better. Overall, this is a B+ phone. Considering this is their first model, not bad.

First off, don't put any stock in any review posted before November, Essential was such a new company, with no existing products, they had to have some bugs when it was first launched. However, since then they have been rolling out software updates to EvErYtHiNg. The other day I got an update for my headphone dongle. The bugs have been all but entirely eradicated and the camera has improved drastically, I have no problem with the camera app right now, it is not perfect, but it takes good pictures reliably. The feel of this phone is like no other phone, it is solid and quality feeling, it reminds me of an iPhone 4 (in a good way). I hate to hold other phones now, they all just feel cheap (pft, aluminium frame). The headphone jack is missing, but the dongle is quality and easy to just leave on your headphones, plus it has a decent DAC, better than would have been in the phone, and the battery and flat architecture are more than worth it. I absolutely recommend this phone to anyone who has a little bit of technical ability (see: following googled directions).",

The phone looks great and feels luxury in hand. However, the small size + heavy material makes the phone extremely dense. While it won't bother most people, it is definetely not for small hands. 2. The camera is not quite impressive. The stock software is definitely not working correctly even with the update. I installed the google zsl hdr+ package and compared so many shots. The google software outperform the stock software 90% of the time. Especially in low light, the noise is much better processed. And the color dynamic range is better with google camera hdr+. Also it focus better with google hdr+. However, sometimes when rotation while using the google app, the screen flashes and sometimes freezes. Therefore, this leaves me no good solution for photography. 3. Not sure if it is just mine. The front camera does not produce sharp image. The exposure won't adjust no matter how I touch different point on the screen. 4. There are some coating imperfection between the screen and frame. Once you notice it, you keep seeing it all the time. This should not happen to a 500 dollar phone.",

The Essential phone is priced about right now on Amazon and the 360 camera thrown in for an extra $50 is great. My biggest complaint is lack if signal strength. I work part-time for Uber and Lyft and have a terrible time now. In neighborhoods where I usually would have full bars I'll just randomly lose signal and it completely screws with the apps I've got running. Suddenly someone is in my car and I can't even navigate to where they're going because the signal is suddenly gone. I never once had this happen with my old S7 edge. On the positive I adore how simple this phone is. No bloatware, super clean design. Great battery life. Decent camera after they pushed out some updates. If they could somehow clean up the reception/signal strength I would give it 4 stars.

Definitely wasn't worth the $700 price tag, but at $500 it isn't terrible. Not as good and smooth as an iPhone 7 or later, and I'm guessing not as good and smooth as a Pixel 2, but if you support their mission statement especially, it really isn't too bad for $500.

This improved it to a notch above my old camera. Some reviews were negative on the stability of Android on the Essential Phone. My experience after installing and testing all the apps I was using on my old phone is that it is as stable the Nexus 5X. I didn't experience any problems before or after the phone completed Android and Security updates. I did have to live with reverting from Oreo to 7.1.1, but the differences are minor and an update is likely soon for non-Google devices like this. I tried to like a Samsung phone, but couldn't deal with the re-skinning of Android and limitations on which apps could be removed/replaced. I've used unlocked Google phones for a few years and didn't like having everything be different but not necessarily better. Overall, I'm pleased with this phone as a replacement for Nexus 5X. I was able to score an open-box item from Amazon bringing the cost below $390. What other similar phone can you buy with the features for that price? One extra feature of the phone that was important to me was being able to connect an HDMI cable to mirror the phone screen to a TV while camping in an RV. Other options like Chrome Cast and Fire TV don't work without high speed internet. Miracast is hobbled by copyright protections preventing casting Netflix and similar content. See the \"Inspira Type C Hub\" for connecting to a TV via HDMI.",

Seeing this phone at $499 instead of the initial launch price of $699 was a no-brainer deal for me! For the first day of use, this phone was wonderful. Camera was great after updating the app (like, really great - on par with most 2017 flagships) and I was blown away by the edge to edge screen. After one day, however, the phone began to freeze suddenly while switching apps or turning off WiFi. I read that this is a common issue that people face but is often alleviated with an exchange. I am awaiting my exchange and hoping that the new phone is better. I really want to like this phone, but if the bad performance is a consistent problem I will have to look elsewhere and await a future generation of this phone. I can imagine it's very difficult to assure quality for a company as new as essential.",

Looks and feels expensive, but didn't break the bank to get. Takes incredible pictures, massive screen, incredible customer service. The only real and true downside is it's just slippery. The ceramic back will slide when I lay my phone on a pad of sticky notes on the desk and slide until it lays flat or slips more in my hand if they're dry. Can stand real and true to the corner drop test but if dropped just right will shatter the screen. A skin or case will solve this, but be aware if you'd rather have it bare.",

It's so different, that people have stopped me to ask what phone it was. I'm on Oreo 8.1 Beta 1 and I haven't really seen the problems that others have talked about yet. I'm coming from a 6P, so I'm missing the stereo speakers, but the PH-1 gets pretty loud without getting tinny on the higher end, which is pretty nice. Battery is great: +6 hours SOT! Personally, I find the camera more than serviceable. Essential's own app is great for Mono photos, but I threw a Google Camera port onto it, and the pictures come out as good as the 6P easily. That's no question. Essential's own stock app is much better than it was before. It's not the hardware that's buggered up, it's the software; the hardware is pretty good. I don't think I\"ll be returning this phone. If you like the design, go for it. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. This phone outperforms everything in its price range; it's a flagship phone with midrange price; can't really go wrong!",

I got 2 of these phones from the cyber monday deal for $400 each for my kids. The specs by itself make that an amazing deal. I mean you get the top of the line CPU/GPU Snapdragon 835, 4GB of ram, 128GB of internal storage and a beautiful screen that almost covers the entire front of the phone. Those are not specs you will find for $400 anywhere. The software is pure stock android and it has not once crashed, slowed down, hiccuped, or has done anything strange. It has not behaved in any way some of the reviews would like you to believe. I also run this on T-mobile and the signal strength in db is identical to my S8+. The voice call is clear and has never dropped. The camera. Let me preface by saying I am not a camera guru so this is purely based on my family's and my feedback. We use auto for 95% of all of our picture taking, even me on my S8+. For these use cases, the quality and speed of the pictures for the Essential phone is great. Be it outdoors or indoors, lots of light or low light, it has all performed well. There aren't nearly as many camera options on the Essential phone compared to the S8+ but I find myself hardly using them anyways. Now the video is interesting. The quality is good but without image stabilizer, I can tell the video is more shaky especially when shooting while walking around. That would be my only negative only because I've grown so used to the stability of S8+ video. All in all, this was an amazing purchase at an amazing price and my kids love it and it will be their phone for a long long time.",

My main criteria for a good phone is user experience. This phone is bare bones and to the point. No duplicate apps, no wow features that clutter up the phones function. This phone is smooth and fast. The build quality is next to none. The size of the screen is 5.7\", bigger than the iPhone plus modelsvin a much smaller package. This is essentials first phone and if they keep it up, it will have e a real winner on their hands and will compete with his the big boys. The only gripe is the Camara performance and I recommend downloading the Google Camara app apk. I encourage anyone who just wants a fast smooth straight forward phone not to hesitate.",

Earlier review: I really can't understand all the negative reviews of the phone - mostly pointed at the camera function. I upgraded to the Essential phone from a Samsung Note 3 which I have owned for the last 4 years. You have to understand that my upgrade to this phone is like trading a Beetle for a Rolls Royce. This phone is light years ahead of what I have been used to. I am completely satisfied with this phone. The build quality of course is stunning but the experience of the functionality is fantastic. The camera is great, no complaints. My Note 3 would take about 5 minutes to load the camera (slight exageration) but seems like it. This thing rocks and don't let anyone influence you otherwise.",

The phone is fast, very attractive, and premium feeling. The camera is good, but it's pretty great if you sideload the Google Pixel camera. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the signal does seem weaker than my Moto X, at least when in low signal areas. If they could fix that in an update, it'd be an easy 5 stars.

I love the fact that it comes standard with 128 GB of space (though with formatting it's a bit less). It feels and handles like a luxury phone with exceptional screen resolution and vibrant colors. All around fantastic phone that is an android purists best friend. Pros: Sturdy feel (but not too heavy) Strong Performance Professional look Cons: No integrated 3.5 mm headphone jack (I don't see this as a big issue as they do include a USB-C to 3.5 mm converter that you can use) No integrated Visual Voicemail app (I believe that this is an issue with many unlocked devices though) How I use the device: I'm a big google services user who uses Straight Talk as a carrier. I stream video regularly and play several graphic intense games. I'm a heavy browser user who regularly uses multiple tabs.

                "review_text": "The Essential Phone makes me\u2026 happy!?! Yeah, I know weird.. happy about a new phone is an odd way of putting it. Maybe, it just feels good and makes me smile. I have the awesome opportunity to trial tons of new handsets from utilitarian to flagship and yet somehow this Essential Phone with LESS tricks and gimmicks is my current favorite over all. It\u2019s hard to put a finger on exactly what it is (no pun intended). I don\u2019t know any other way to put it.. the haptic feedback on the Essential phone is.. delicious. No, you can't change the vibration intensity (yet), but I don't want to. It just has the perfect feel. I think part of the feedback feel is due to the solid body design with the titanium and ceramic. Running a finger across the screen feels SO nice. It\u2019s the nicest touch screen I\u2019ve run my finger across to be honest\u2026 so smooth. My finger literally glides across the surface. I don\u2019t use screen protectors any more. Just too much hassle and often times reduced responsiveness. So, with no screen protectors I can say when comparing this to say my S8+, the glass is just less 'tacky'. Swype typing on the Essential PH-1 is a pleasure and I find it to be much more accurate than on any handset I\u2019ve used thus far. That's pretty impressive. Snappy! OK, so I only just got this thing and barely loaded it up with Apps. I wanted a clean start \u2013 and what that means is a clean phone. Essential, not just a clever name\u2026 only comes with 21 \u2018essential\u2019 apps pre installed. 20 really, but with the version from Sprint you also get the Sprint account manager (My Sprint) which is the only carrier app on the device to track usage, pay bills etc. It's nice to be able to load what I want and it I like not having to go in to setting to shut off notifications from OEM and carrier bloat. What else? A clean android experience. I\u2019ve never used a Pixel/Nexus, so I had no clue what \u2018stock\u2019 android was really supposed to be. Now I do. It\u2019s fast \u2013 blazing fast. Opening up the menu pull down from the top of the device is quick and not loaded with a trillion customization options. Sliding up from the bottom brings up the app tray snappy and fast too. I know, nowadays people love all the additional options, but that isn\u2019t what this device is really about. For example, my S8+ has 23 system options from the top pull down whereas the essential has 10 by default, and you know what? I really don\u2019t need more than that. Other options are still available in the settings menu for example the ability to turn on/off NFC, though anyone that uses NFC would probably argue they keep this on most of the time and not need to shut it off in a hurry. Which by the way, if all that customization is important you can always go with a \u2018launcher\u2019 from the Play store rather than one that\u2019s forced upon you by a device manufacturer. I\u2019m just starting to understand that now. On the one hand you have the major custom ROMs by device manufactures and on the other (Nexus) a completely unblemished version of Android. Then there\u2019s the Essential which leans more towards stock, but adds just the right amount of personalization to make you feel like it\u2019s a unique experience. I do agree at times it\u2019s nice to have some of the manufacturer specific options and things we\u2019re used to seeing (like Touchwiz/Saumsung Experience). I just hadn\u2019t realized what I gave up in Android responsiveness in order to have the manufacturer specific Android mods. I may have to test it out with a launcher at some stage just to see if it functions as fast as it feels now. The default ringtone is nice and not obnoxious and I like the new unobtrusive text tone too. It\u2019s all google messaging with the latest version as well as google keyboard and ability to text with GIF\u2019s etc. My favorite feature so far? Home Screen Rotation! I haven\u2019t seen a handset where the home screen turns! Almost all handsets don\u2019t rotate the actual home screen, only the apps. I love the way the phone looks in landscape. The screen and colors are beautiful too. Granted I find it to be just slightly less bright than say the GS8+, but the colors seem to be more \u2018authentic\u2019 and realistic. By the way, for those reading\u2026 I think the S8 is an amazing device and I\u2019m not knocking it in any way. Really, up until now I\u2019ve been touting it as the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. We\u2019ll see how I feel about the Essential in the coming weeks to see if the \u2018new car smell\u2019 so to speak wears off and if I\u2019m back to my love affair with the S8. The screen looks awesome when on a call. Simple, clean and bright. Personally I like the camera at the top of the screen, rather than an unusable bar taking up part of he screen. Looks great with websites too. Haven't done video yet... Additional things \u2013 Activation was a breeze on Sprint.com with exception of one additional step. After activating the device I needed to go to the dial pad and enter *#*#72786#*#* in order to have the device reset with the network (took a min) and it downloaded a new MR to the latest software version.Not a bad idea to do that upon activation for those reading. The Sprint network has been excellent on this device with full bars and quick loads of streaming audio and web pages. I\u2019ve made a couple of calls so far. Using the handset to my ear and using on speaker phone has been a pleasant experience. The speaker is loud and clear. I did use the adapter for the headset using the Samsung S8 earbuds and was told there was a lot of \u2018noise\u2019, but so far that was with two calls. This is early days so I\u2019ll report back. So far I really really like this phone. It makes me happy. Have questions/thoughts about the Essential? Let me know.",

                "review_text": "I am an extremely value-conscious shopper when it comes to expensive electronics and, after extensive research, this won my seal of approval. With this phone, you get 2017- early 2018 flagship performance and top-notch hardware at a price that compares favorably to alternatives (Samsung Galaxy S8/9, HTC U11, Google Pixel 2/XL, LG V30, Moto Z2 Force, etc.). The main competitor at this price point is the OnePlus 5T, which offers some advantages including a UI with more features, a polished camera app, larger screen, more RAM, and a headphone jack. However, the essential phone overall has a more premium feel with the materials used, and a beautiful bezel-less display that helps 'future-proof' the phone (based on the mobile world congress this year, a lot of phones are heading in that direction), and more storage. The 'Halo Gray' variant also has a nice matte finish on the back that is easy to grip and not as much of a fingerprint magnet as the ceramic. If you are looking for a phone that has good enough performance for most things look at options below $400 like Honor 7X, Moto G or X series, HTC U11 Life. Options coming to the US this year include the Nokia 6 (2018) and possibly ASUS Zenfone 5 (unclear if releasing in the US). Or you could get a used flaghsip phone, but that of course has its risks.",

I chose the 128GB model and I doubt I will fill even half of it. It feels solid and has a good heft. With the case I purchased for it, I feel as if the phone would survive just about any fall. Overall, it's a great phone. I hope to have this for at least the next 3 years.",

                "review_text": "I loved the Essential phone! I spent two days setting it all up and then when I was out of WIFI, I realized that no data worked over the air only via Wi-Fi. I read so many negative reviews and I really thought everyone was wrong! The phone itself is the perfect size and hardware was very nice. I want to love this phone but now after two days to configure and 5 plus hours working with Sprint, I am disappointed to say all of my work to configure the phone to my perfection was all for nothing! Sprint put a new sim card in the phone, and since that did not work they said they needed to do a factory reset. All my hard work and feeling of having a phone to my liking was now reset to factory. Now all I have to show for my hard work is a nice phone that is reset that still wont access the internet over the air only via WIFI. I want to love this phone!! But now I must return it. The worst part is the time I spent is lost and now I will be without a phone until I get a new phone. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0748TWQHK/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 Amazon and Essential, please help me to love this phone, it has so much potential. I am posting an update. Amazon provided info for essential support and they contacted me with things to check. Nothing worked. I left them phone off for 8 hours and apparently Sprint reset the Phone on their network. All the issues were Sprint an not the phone. I have changed the rating to four stars. I will update the review after I try the camera. Everthing else beats my I-phone 6 s plus. If all goes well, I will buy another for my wife!!! Amazon or Essential, can we purchase the essentail phone service protection?",

                "review_text": "The negative buzz surrounding this phone regarding the camera (plus the original price point) was what made me hold off on buying this, but it seems like Essential's pain was my gain. Having seen the price go down $250 (caught this phone when it was down to $450) and the camera undergo many patches I decided to take the plunge. Taking it as it is now (Apr 2018) as opposed to what it was at launch, I can recommend this phone. First off, Android 8.1 runs fast and smooth, very slick as one would demand a (then) cutting edge Snapdragon phone to have. Form factor is amazing - it looks gorgeous and the material weight makes it very tactile without feeling hefty. The matte finish on this helps with my grip, at least. Camera, as per the title, is honestly not that bad. It may be damning with faint praise but I find it fine. You will see it shortcomings upon heavy zoom but in terms of 100% view and ability to be printed out on, say, 7 x 5in it is perfectly serviceable. No phone shoots well in low-light anyway. So yes, a solid first effort for Essential, and with the price drop, the best bang-for-buck premium phone on the market. This phone will last me a while, I feel.",

                "review_text": "I purchased this phone when reviews were just so-so, but after the price dropped to $500, I figured I'd take a risk and purchased this phone. It definitely paid off, as I've been using this phone for over a month now, and I am in love with this device. I switched over to Android in August of 2017 after using iPhones for over 6 years. I needed a phone and purchased the Moto g4 play because it was the cheapest phone I could get that day. I got tired of the slow processor and limited RAM on that phone, but I didn't want to Shell out $700+ on a phone just to get the latest and greatest. When I first got this phone, it seemed quite buggy and would completely freeze up from time to time, but after many software updates, including camera app updates, this is my favorite device out of any I have ever used. I use this phone for everything, from streaming movies to doing homework to taking pictures, and I couldn't be more impressed. I love how there is no bloatware on this phone and no logos on it whatsoever. Here are the pros and cons of this device from my point of view: Pros: +No Bloatware - The Essential Ph-1 is as stock Android as it gets ((even moreso than Pixel phones). The launcher is the stock Android launcher (launcher3), which does not offer much in terms of customization. All of the apps that come with this device are needed to function properly, and you can customize your experience to suit your individual needs. +Bezel-less Design - Yes, there is a small bezel along the bottom of the screen, but I have found that it is actually beneficial for avoiding accidental screen touches. +Premium Feel - I have never held a phone that feels this good in my hands. I use a case when I am out and about, but I take it off while at home or work just to enjoy the feel of this phone. The smoothness of the titanium and ceramic coupled with the added weight of the phone make it feel special. Even the haptic feedback feels better than in other devices I've used. The vibrations are audible in silent rooms, but it has a great feel to it. Many of my friends with other Android phones like the feel so much that they will play with my phone just to feel the haptic feedback. It's small things like this that make the Essential phone truly enjoyable to use. +The Camera - While this phone started off with terrible camera performance, the many updates to the camera app have caused me to truly enjoy taking pictures. While its camera performance isn't as good as that of the iPhone X, I am able to take better pictures on the Essential Ph-1 than my coworker can on his Pixel XL(first gen). The front-facing camera performs better than any other phone I've used as well. With the latest camera app update, portrait mode is now enabled, and low-light image quality is greatly improved, which puts this camera near the top in terms of performance. +Magnetic Attachments - While there is only one out at the moment, more are said to come in the future. I use the 360 degree camera attachment quite often and am quite pleased with the results. As soon as you attach it, the camera app opens and allows you to take a picture or video. The results so far have been better than I expected. Cons: -No Headphone Port - While this is a big deal for some people, I only use Bluetooth for audio, so it doesn't bother me. It is an unfortunate compromise for some, but most phone companies are abandoning this feature, giving consumers little choice in the matter. If you want to use wired headphones, the dongle included in the box works well. -Lack of Waterproofing - While many newer phones are water resistant, the Essential phone forgoes this feature. This doesn't bother me for a couple of reasons: 1. I never use phones in and around the water, and 2. Water resistance can be compromised by scratches, dents, or cracks on certain parts of the device. -No Expandable Storage - This also doesn't bother me because I will never even fill up the 128gb of internal storage, but for those that would like this option, you're out of luck with this phone. -No Wireless Charging - While Essential is supposedly working on a charging dock that connects via the magnetic pins, it doesn't support wireless charging on the Qi standard, which is an inconvenience for those who are used to this feature. -Smooth Design - While it feels great to hold in your hand, the smooth design of this phone means that it will easily slide off smooth surfaces (like pants), so putting this phone on your lap without a case could lead to an unfortunate fall. Therefore, I would recommend using a case (or skin of you want to keep things minimalistic) in order to add some texture to the ceramic back. -Limited Selection of Device Protection - While there are more cases and screen protectors out now than a month ago, there aren't as many options as there are for other devices. There is one tempered glass screen protector that covers the whole screen without having a halo effect, but its weak adhesion allows the case to push it off. The limited selection of cases is mostly due to the limited amount of these phones initially sold, but Essential is partially to blame for claiming this phone doesn't need a case to withstand drops. There have been drop tests conducted with this phone that show the phone is not impervious to falls, so a case is a must in my opinion. While there are some downsides to this phone that may deter some people from purchasing it, the Essential Ph-1 is a truly great device, especially when you consider that this is the company's first phone. If $500 is too much for you to spend on a phone, and you live in the US, Sprint is currently offering the device for a great price ($25 down and $5 a month for an 18 month flex lease) if you want this phone but aren't sure you want to buy the device outright, and right now, they have a promotion offering the 360 degree camera free with a lease or purchase. If you are an Android enthusiast that isn't bothered by the cons presented in this review, this phone is definitely worth looking into!",

Strangely, but fortunately, rebooting my router fixed the problem, and ever since it's connected without fail. It's fast and has worked flawlessly. Just upgraded to Oreo 8.1. The camera has produced a few pictures that could be better, particularly in very bright light, but the monochrome camera is excellent. Also I use Lightroom and that's a great way to use the camera's sensor but not the Essential software. Certainly heavier than previous phones I've owned, especially the iphone 6, but then again it won't bend like an iphone 6. As others have noted, it's extremely well built. At Amazon's price, it's a great value for a premium phone.",

The hardware is top notch, extremely high quality build and feel and flawless performance. The camera is the only downside but it has been improved a lot through updates to the point where I don't feel like it is a sacrifice anymore. The form factor is perfect - enough screen to do anything on but just small enough to use with one hand. This was really important to me and this phone has delivered where no others have. Handling of the phone is very good too, the square edged frame has a beveled edge that is a matte finish which really helps with grip. The software is excellent and updates consistent.

I remember hearing about this phone last year and then became disappointed to hear that the phone was buggy and also quite expansive.

Once I got it, there was a notification to upgrade the phone to Android Oreo 8.0 which of course, I did. The phone is very fast with the SnapDragon 835 processor and 4 Gb's of Ram. The 128 Gb for storage is very nice too. The screen and camera have both been brilliant (thought the screen could be brighter). Sound is nice and loud. Fingerprint scanner is placed well.

                "review_text": "*** UPDATE *** 4/21/18 Two days after receiving the phone and struggling to get the phone to work with straighttalk verizon, I figured out that if I turn the wifi off and restart the phone, my LTE capabilities are enabled and the APN in the phone is updated. Not sure why it couldn't update when it was connected to WiFi. For some reason,the phone wasn't updating the APN correctly and in the new oreo update you can't add or edit APNs unless you root the phone (which voids the warranty), but I did it anyway and even editing the APN didn't work. I also had to go get a new SIM card because according to straighttalk, only one SIM can be registered to one IMEI. I didn't know that, but I am still able to put the NEW SIM back into my old S7 and it works fine.. not sure about that one. It may also be worth mentioning that I tried to take the phone to Verizon yesterday (4/20) and they were unable to add the phone to their prepaid network using its IMEI. He tried it three times but said their system was being weird that day so maybe I was just having a stroke of bad luck. Maybe straighttalk changed the way the operate over the past year or two, not sure because I have had the S7 since it came out and that's the last SIM I had to buy. Just be prepared to have this problem if you are trying to swap the sims and expecting it to work. Enjoying the phone like I should be now, just had some minor hiccups with the service provider. As promised, I took some low light pictures in the bar and of my dogs in my dark bedroom. The camera is not the best in low light situations, but I rarely take photos at night so this isn't really a problem for me as I have a photography camera that is much more well suited for things of that nature. The phone is 250$ cheaper than the Pixel 2 as of right now so you can expect somewhat of a quality difference between cameras, but this phone looks sharper and feels really solid. I don't take a lot of bar pictures because I'm usually drunk and forget, so again that really isn't a problem for me. I read some reviews about the fingerprint scanner being bad, but mine unlocks faster than my mom's iPhone 8 and my old S7, it's almost instant. If my finger is on the scanner and I hit the power button, it unlocks immediately. The only complaint I have is the phone isn't waterproof. I've never needed it on any other phone, but it's nice to not have to worry about accidental splashes. *ORIGINAL REVIEW* 4/18/18 Love the phone, super snappy, looks awesome and feels like a quality device. The only thing that originally stopped me from getting the phone sooner was all the reviews of the camera, which in my experience is awesome. Front facing camera looks amazing, as well as the rear camera. Photos in well lit areas look good, don't think the camera is as sharp in low light as the Pixel 2 though. I'm coming from a galaxy S7 and this takes better pictures than my girlfriends iPhone 7 and my moms iPhone 8, can't compare it to the X though because I don't know anyone with it so I just youtubed comparison videos and they are all on par with each other. If the camera reviews are stopping you from buying, don't worry, it looks great. Haven't had the chance to take low light bar selfies due to finals but I plan to this weekend so I will update the original review with my opinion. The phone is also super slick, so you will definitely want to get a case. I got the Poetic Guardian case with the plastic front screen protector and it covers the entire phone well. Couldn't find a glass screen protector so I had to go with the all-in-one combo. Display looks awesome outside in sunlight even though it isn't OLED. No problems seeing it inside a plastic screen case with sunlight directly on it. There is a major issue with the phone though. My service works completely fine (straighttalk - verizon sim) on my unlocked galaxy S7, which I have actually switched back to because of service problems. I have factory reset, updated, factory reset, and updated again, and I still can't get straighttalk to work on this phone. Putting the sim card back in my S7 gives me instant service, I can browse fine, and there are no problems. I'm not an idiot, and actually really want to like this phone, but I can't because it isn't a phone, its a 400$ camera/paperweight. I even changed the APN multiple times on the device, disabled enhanced LTE per instruction of a reddit thread to no avail. It gets onto wifi fine and downloads updates, but it will not connect to my mobile service for web-browsing, I can however make calls. This device needs far more work, it could have been a really great device but I feel it's rushed. I will most likely be sending this back to Amazon and purchasing a Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL. For now, I'm using my broke screen galaxy S7 because at least it works lol",

Not having headphone jack is minor, you get an adapter w the phone. It is heavier than other phones, but not like it's a brick.

There is no 3.5mm headphone jack, but Essential includes a USB C to 3.5mm adapter in the box. You won't be missing your old headphones with this. The audio quality, if anything, short of a good external dac and a $250+ set of headphones (none of which I'd want to carry with me). A good quality set of buds, the adapter, and the phone are all I need - the expensive stuff stays at home, in the office/lounge. The audio quality is great for what is expected with a cellphone these days - no cutouts, no distortion, just good deep audio (when using good buds or headphones). Note, that you can't charge and listen at the same time (which I've never done prior to this anyway). As for performance - I play a few games; GTA: SA and KOTOR run perfectly, along with some emulation. This phone has handled everything I throw at it, and well. The battery life, with a little tweaking easily lasts me 3.5 to 4 days, with around 5-6 hours of screen on time, easily as long distance as my E4 plus was but with better performance in apps I use. Overall, unless you're dead set on a One plus, this is the best deal for an 835 phone today. I highly recommend it if you want a good looking phone, with good battery life, and great sound.",

I've heard that the camera app has been much improved, but honestly, I found it almost unusable and had to download a third party camera app. Even with that, the picture quality and camera abilities are still disappointing. Within the first week of having the phone, it froze while I was using it for bluetooth music. I wasn't using it for anything else. It was stuck on the screen saver and was unresponsive for about ten minutes. Finally, it came back on and loaded like nothing happened. A week later, the same thing happened in the same situation. Unfortunately, the phone froze (while using it for bluetooth music) while I was on a road trip today and left me totally without directions. This time, it froze for two hours, then died and will not turn back on or hard reset. I contacted Amazon, and they say it's a defective battery and offered a replacement, but I will not take the chance that this happens again. Thankfully, they are allowing me to send the device back for a refund.",

Maybe it's the Snapdragon 835 with its 4gb of RAM, but I've never had a better Android experience. Everything is much more fluid than I remember. My first thoughts when I received the phone were about the quality of packaging. Essential did a good job. I was pleased with the presentation mostly for the unique box itself. It has a plastic wrap which was rather difficult to remove without the proper scalpel having only fingernails, but I managed to release the device from its plastic shroud. I found a pull tab on the label, which removing revealed the ingenious drawer-like box in a box form. Compared to your standard rectangular prism, the more square shape is refreshing. You open the box and everything is layed out in front of you. My only complaint as far as what's inside is that there is no USB A to C adapter included. For the price at present, in my opinion this is the best phone for money. With the updates to come both in the form of software and hardware, this phone will only get better. Great phone so far, after 48 hours. I'll try to update this in about a month.",

PROS: All the camera issues people talked about are resolved from what I can tell due to the app and software update. Also I love the battery life, It gets me a solid 24 hours with regular social media scrolling and trolling, taking pictures and videos through out the day, and even streaming music to my speakers. I am guessing the battery life is so good because there is not any bloatware running programs in the background. The fingerprint and face recognition unlock work great. I love the how the screen extends all the way down and to the edges, and it is not too bulky. CONS The finish is so smooth, you will drop it if you don't put a case on it. There is no shortcut to turn the Location settings on and off. You have to go to the settings menu and scroll to the security and location tabs, open it up, and then turn it on or off. (too much work for me) Or ask the google assistant to do it. You can not change the set of Icons available in the top pull down status bar.

(The manufacturing tolerances must be measured in the .001 range.) It is impressive under magnification. True, the Camera and its supporting software is only average when compared to any other stock Android experience, but Essential has proven their commitment by promptly updating the device firmware to resolve initial release issues. Just using the Pixel Camera App improved picture quality substantially. Think of the Essential PH-1 as the new Sony PlayStation 5, rushed to the public with only 1 or two game titles, Pong being one of them; yes, it would disappointment, but given time to refine and update the release of new software and it will blow everything out of the water because the Hardware is \"there\"... There is no other device in the market that matches the choice of materials, build quality or design aesthetic. The software experience will improve regularly, and with Essential supporting the ROM community by releasing their Kernel Source, you can bet the sky will be the limit... so ignore the Camera, ignore the lean, lackluster software, ignore the yet to be experienced \"lag\" or \"lock-ups\". As it stands in its [Beta] form, it performs better than my Pixel, the S8+ and on par with the OnePlus 5 . -and in a few weeks, it should exceed any current device in terms of performance, as it already does in the context of hardware.",

Any reviews you've heard about this device missing the mark are from people that want to spend $1000 on a device because they think it's about status. But this phone is about getting the best, about having a pure Android device backed by a company that's constantly pushing updates and giving their customers the freedom to customize their phone and make it their own. This phone is for people that want a company that will support their device and their customers, and not lock it down. This is the first generation Essential PH-1, and there have been weird quirks and bugs, and that's to be expected, but Essential has done what no other modern device manufacturer does: updates and customer service. That in itself is work the price that's half of what you'd pay for another \"flagship\" device.",

Other thoughts, it's a slippery phone, so you will want a case and screen protector. It does collect finger prints as well, but you are holding the thing so get over it. I also tried the 360 degree camera, it is pretty cool, and easy to use. I wouldn't pay full asking price for it though. Amazon had the phone and 360 degree camera bundled for very cheap.",

I hate that the phone slides off of anything and everything. Very annoying. Andy Rubin marketed this phone as not requiring a case. I purchased the phone on that premise. I didn't use cases with my prior phones and did not have issues. However, I couldn't get away without using a case and screen protector with this phone. Very happy with my phone.",

Looked for a while for uk seller, but they wanted to much money, so checked Amazon U S A and took a gamble. Some how you think an american phone might be different to uk. After two weeks or so it turned up on the day I sold the s8. It arrived about a week early. It is a quality item, build is super solid , the soft wear experience is smooth with no clutter. I am so pleased I did this through Amazon. Many thanks",

I only have had the phone for a couple of days, here are my initial observations: 1) The build quality is great and looks amazing. If I have to nitpick, the buttons could be made even better, looks cheap compared to everything else 2) The phone is so sleek, it pains me to say that it needs a phone case as it is a little slippery, unfortunately 3) Some have cell reception issues, but I am on T-mobile in NYC metro area and it seems similar to what I had before 4) Camera seems to be good, maybe not as good as pixel or iphone, but good enough for me. They even had a camera update enabling portrait mode 5) Touch sensitivity could be better, especially around edges, but doesn't seem to be a major issue. There is some jankiness, but the phone is so good to look at, you don't really notice it I bought it at $399 on Cyber Monday, so it was a steal. I really think if they had come out now rather than in August, they would have had much better reviews!",

Camera I've also found to be great and can't understand the reviews, unless it was a problem at the release of this phone.. would I recommend yes. Would I buy again from essential too right..",

                "review_text": "Upgrading from a g5, I absolutely love the phone. I've been using it daily for about a month now and it is so far one of my favorite phones I've ever owned. The camera app has been my only complaint, but it is getting upgraded with nearly every new software update (every couple of weeks or so) and has already seen several major improvements. However, going from a phone that had a wide viewing camera too (this one doesn't, it has a native black and white second camera that I rarely use), it has been quite an adjustment. My LG also had a double tap option to turn on the screen and a \"flip the phone over\" option to turn off the alarm, which I greatly miss, but I recognize those are only things I will find on LG anyways (which isn't worth it with the price). The battery life is phenomenal. Using it with 4G through the majority of my day I still typically have a good charge left when I go to sleep at night (after a 17 hour day that often starts with an hour of video watching). The signal is actually much better than expected (at least in Verizon) and areas where I experienced lost calls or bad signal now have no issues. The build quality is pretty great, although I still recommend a case. The phone is very quick and I love the option to use the cloud for my photos so that they don't take up any space on my phone. If you are an audiophile, the single bottom speaker may annoy you. It does get loud but doesn't carry very powerful sound if you're often using it as the only thing to listen to music. The screen is nice and bright, although I did receive a version that seemed too dark at first even on its brightest setting (Essential was happy to replace it with no extra cost). I appreciate the lack of bloatware and the quick software updates that are often either on par with or faster than the \"name brands\". The fingerprint reader is placed perfectly and incredibly snappy. The customization options are fabulous. Although there have been some issues with people receiving defective phones, Essential seems happy to stand behind their product and offer a replacement. I ordered mine on Amazon to ensure I also had Amazon backing and free returns should anything happen. So far, what I ordered as an \"experiment\" phone has proved itself as a very, very good (although not perfect) daily driver. Especially for the price. Overall the MAIN things that stood out are as follows. Pros: - wonderful battery life - very fast - quick software updates - Amazon/essential stand behind the product - great service (at least with Verizon) - nice build quality - good camera Cons - camera software - lack of wide-screen angle camera - occasionally defective products",

Very soon after receiving it, however, I noticed that when answering incoming call, (I was using it on Verizon Wireless), 90% of the time, I could not hear the caller, and the caller could not hear me. After 10-12 seconds, there was a slight but audible 'pop' from the phone, and then both sides could hear the call fine. The problem is, most of the time the person calling would have already hung up the phone after this long of a delay. I thought this problem might be related to my Martian mvoice watch, so I completely disabled it, but the problem persisted. Also, I have never experienced this problem when the Martian watch was used with a different phone... Finally, I returned the phone and ordered a replacement. The replacement arrived on a Friday and worked properly for the entire weekend, making me think that my first phone had just been defective. Monday morning, the exact same issue started happening again with the replacement phone. I reached out to Essential and received absolutely no help. No amount of factory resetting or installing all available updates would get the phone to work properly. I finally had to return the second phone to Amazon as well, and even though this phone COULD have been really nice, I would not recommend it....",

The biggest disappointment on this phone is the camera. Even after I did the update I felt it was still below average. I did install the Google camera app and the picture quality at least came out acceptable. I ended up returning mine as I didn't like the camera quality and the smaller form factor. Oh, and yes it's a 5.7 inch display but since it's 18:9 screen when watching videos it would shrink to 16:9 so you end up with black bars on the sides so the display looked more like 5 inches.",

I was excited to see this phone arrive because I am one always looking out of the \"norm\" of what others do. This phone allows every carrier and is so easy to setup, pop in the SIM card and go. It feels so sturdy in your hand; although it may feel like it will slip a lot due to the all aluminum body and gorilla glass. But what I love about it, is not one scratch has occurred anywhere on the device; even dropping it a few times and removing the fingerprints on the back. There is no bloatware as others have mentioned, and that's wonderful. To have a beautiful phone and not need to buy a bulky case for it was such a dealbreaker. The only problem I have had with it is random Wifi connectivity drops, but a quick reboot and it's back to normal. I hope this is just software related, as it's running android 7.1.1.",

From the very beginning, it was obvious that the signal reception was sub par, even compared to the over 2 year older Nexus 6P (I am on TMobile, and in an area where the Nexus works perfectly, always). However, I did not bother since both data and voice was fairly usable and with the 'hope' that future updates will fix the reception issues. Post several updates, and especially after the Android 8.1 upgrade, the signal reception has become even worse - same spots, unusable now. Restarts, resets and waste of several valuable hours troubleshooting did not help. I am back to my Nexus 6P for regular use and its as reliable as ever!! It's a shame on Essential that they failed so spectacularly; compare that to some other start ups that has done fairly well even with limited resources! Example: I handed over my 4 year old OnePlus One to a relative on the other side of the globe, and it still works. So, just stay away from Essential, at least folks who intend to continue with TMobile as your network.",

                "review_text": "As a tech enthusiast, and someone who is very much invested in the Google/Android ecosystem, when I first came across info regarding the Essential Ph-1, I was immediately interested. As hardware and design goes, the device is an love letter to the industry that Andy Rubin and his peers ( obviously the late Steve Jobs is another crucial figure ) founded. This smartphone screams premium to all human senses. It looks amazing, it feels amazing, I love the weight, the ergonomics. And for sure the LCD packeged with the phone comes as close to Amoled as an LCD can, so no complaints there. For a brand new company's first product of the caliber, it ticks all the right marks, as hardware and design goes. But for a smartphone that was sold at a premium when it first launched, the software was underbaked, making for an less than desirable day to day use, as per highly acclaimed tech reviewers on YouTube, and rightly so. Fast forward to January 2018, and several discounts, quality of life software updates, and continued support from the Essential team, have made this phone a steal for around $400 on Amazon. The software, a vanilla version of Android ( my go to version always ) fells well optimized now for the latest Qualcomm SoC. I don't care much for cameras on smartphones, as long as it's a decent shot. My issue was connectivity when I first turned on the phone. Living in NYC one expects good service most anywhere. But on T-Mobile it wasn't the case, at first. Yet after a quick Google/ YouTube search, I found the code needed to make the device stick with an always LTE connection. And as such, with LTE+ available for me, my speed tests range from 30 to 50mb download and upload, even with half the service bar available once in a while. So yeah, all in all, for some $400-500 (depending on the retailer), I feel this was an amazing purchase, and I certainly hope Essential as a company last long enough to prove they can be the next Samsung or Apple, or even surpass these two dinosaurs. Talent is for sure at the core of Essential. The smartphone gets 5* from me, in its current state, but mostly because I appreciate the attention to detail in the hardware design. As a whole, I'd normally give a 4* do to slight hickups here and there, software wise. As is, it's a very good daily driver for me so far. And with further optimization one a stable version of Android 8.1 rolls out, I'm confident many of the small issues still present will be ironed out. My advice is, once you decide to purchase this phone, and insert the SIM card of your carrier of choice, do a quick search on how to further optimize the phone on your on. Definitely let it do it's 4 updates, as of now. They improve quite a lot. And in the end you'll be holding what the Essential PH-1 was always meant to be. A love letter to the industry, now at half the price. Hope this helps! Take care!",

Sometimes it takes 2, or 3 \"hits\", before the touch registers. I've had it for like a week or 2 now, and it's already fully locked up 3 times. The WiFi to LTE hand-off is ... inconsistent.. Generally if i want it to work when i come off WiFi, or get onto WiFi, i need to reboot for it actually work. If i turn on my HotSpot, the WiFi doesn't automatically turn off... which means the hotspot doesnt work. So to enable the HotSpot i need to turn that on, and WiFi off each time. When WiFi is on, it shows 0 bars for phone service, yet calls still can go in and out. Signal strength is about half as good as previous phones (half as many bars on wifi and lte, in the same spot where other phones get full) Roughly half the time, at least half the time i bother to check, it says \"Charging slowly\" when plugged into the provided fast charger ( with included cord). Don't know why it says that.... Sometimes when i attempt to make a call, it will just sit there, not actually dial out. I will hit hang up, and it will automatically open up again, this time actually dialing out. The 360 phone is a fun novelty.. not something i would ever buy, but it came with the phone... it's pretty slow, and snapping it on to the phone was the cause of one of my complete lockups i mentioned before. The battery life is really good.. The camera is acceptable. Haven't dropped it yet, so can't speak to durability. Over all... if they can work out all the bugs, i'd be totally in love with this phone. Hardware wise, it's awesome. But now, i feel quite a bit of regret buying it.",

I've received the full refund from Amazon even if the Cyber Monday deal was not apply to Best Buy and I lose that deal which costs me more with $300. Anyway, the phone it's amazing fast, clean and very-very stable. I have used (the Best Buy bought PH1) for a while now and I can really say that I love it, it's so premium, best quality device, fast, incredible fast, very good looking design,..., awesome. I had no issues even that I've updated to the latest software version Oreo Beta 1. As for the camera, after all the updates and of course if you use the google app - it's pretty good and really that it no way a CONS for this great device. Again, I am a software engineer, I love to have latest technologies, devices and peripherals, this phone is amazing, no extra applications or garbage applications that almost all the smartphones and also the iPhones come with. The battery life is great, it resist longer than my wife super iPhone. The sounds is really load. The screen is amazing. The fingerprint senor works perfect and is in right location (if somebody ask me). Really amazing phone. I will recommend anybody who love hi tech and premium feelings. Absolutely love this phone and the 360 camera accessory.",

Contacted support and they had me give them a laundry list of things. They I was told the issue was because of the Oreo update for Droid and it should be fixed once it updated. That did fix anything. Then on April 5th April 6th oero had another update. Now my phone dismounts my sim card and my carrier is not listed. Contacted support and they tell me and send me the APN settings for my carrier. But it was the same things that is stored in the phone already. Then I was told that my imei number wasn't registered with the carrier. So I contact my carrier and guess what my imei is just fine. So I bought a new SIM to see if that worked...yeah no luck there. So most of the time this phone doesn't keep my carrier activitied. As a whole I'm very disappointed with the customer support.

                "review_text": "One month in and I must say that this phones lives up to all the expectations I had for it. Let's break it down: Pros: - Flagship build quality. - Mid-range price. - Feels solid, has a slight heft to it. - Size is right, fits the hand a lot better than the Nexus 6. - Stock (or close enough) Android. - Camera picture quality is good (caveat in the cons). - 128 GB of space. - Battery life. Easily getting at least 20 hours of regular use from it (streaming music on the daily commute, reading a little, playing a couple games, checking news and email, etc.) Cons: - Camera picture quality in low-light (likely fixable through software but not holding out for it). - Ceramic back and titanium bevels scratch easily. Nothing major but cosmeticly annoying. Screen is good. - Screen could use a little more \"umph\". Brightness is not quite up to expectations in sunlight. - Camera app is very... untefined. Not \"essential,\" just doesn't feel like it was finished. Overall, I would (and have) recommended this phone to a lot of people. My wife likes it even though she is an Apple user, says it's a lot like her iPhone 6S. There is still a lot of detail work that needs to be done, especially with the camera app, but Essential has shown themselves more than willing and now it's just a waiting game. Looking forward to see what Essential does next. I would really love to see a tablet from them.",

The single firing speaker is very loud and fairly clear without crackles. I have experienced only one or two app hang-ups my week with the phone, otherwise it performs quite smoothly. Charging the phone with the USB-C charger is very fast, and the battery life easily lasts me throughout a day of moderate use. The camera could use some improvements, and I wish that the company would make an official stance on hardware support down the road (currently they will not say how much a battery replacement will cost, or even if it will be offered), but at this price ($450 as of this post) I really have no regrets about my purchase.",

Decent quality in good light conditions, but extremely bad in darker surroundings. Even when it is sunny, the colors are a little dull. When it is just a little darker you have to cope with noise and washed out edges. Dynamic range is bad. All this in comparison to an more than one year old iPhone 7. It is slippery as hell. I recommend a skin for the back. Display size is great, i really love the form factor. The iPhone ore Samsung Galaxy are too narrow. Screen is bright enough and Android works good - no issues for me. But without a decent camera it just isn't going to be my daily phone. The fingerprint sensor is also not as good. I've dry fingertips and it is not a problem for the iPhone, but with the PH-1 I sometimes need 4 attempts to unlock the phone. I uploaded a pic as comparison. Left iPhone 7 right Ph-1 - bad light, just my desk. I have the latest updates installed (camera and phone) and I try'd the google camera (still not good enough). That review is in no means a vote for the iPhone, I really wanted it to be my new phone, but...",

So, for now, ignore the Camera comments below. This phone keeps getting better. If you're looking for a high end phone, but don't have the budget for similarly equipped phone. This is the phone you want. I've had the phone for a couple of months now. The good: Performance: it's fast for everything I do. Look/feel: it looks good and feels sturdy. It's actually heavier than a lot of phones out there. That's comforting Vanilla Android: No bloatware, fast updates Responsive support: I've had a couple of questions, they were answered within 24 hours. Battery life: I charge overnight, use the heck out of the phone all day with everything turned on (WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, decent screen brightness) at the end of my day (midnight) I still have somewhere around 40% battery life left. I'm pretty sure if I were more aggressive about power management I could go 2 days on a charge. The not so good: It's a 1st generation phone, with first generation issues. (eg: Bluetooth turns off with no warning periodically) Mitigating that is that fast updates. The camera: There's no excuse for this camera really. It's slow, and the quality is poor. I've seen rumors that there's an upcoming software update that will make it better. But that hasn't made it yet. The 360 camera is fun to play with, but for me: no practical use. I keep reading about touch/scroll lag issues. But honestly: I haven't noticed that. If you're wanting a daily driver and can live with the camera being less than premium until they fix it, this is definitely the phone for you.",

I got this phone with the 360. I love 360 camera. And the fact that it can livestream in Facebook made me love it more. But the phone is frustrating to use. I used this as my work phone so mostly emails, photos, and video conference. It freezes during app switching. It was getting to the point that I had to wait 10 seconds for it to unfreeze itself. I\u2019m a busy person and waiting for 10 seconds, or longer sometimes, when I have emails and work to do ruins my experience with this phone. When I take photos it comes out purely green. I waste my time retaking the photo. I thought about holding on to this phone and wait for an update to smooth things. But time is money. I need my investment to work now. I\u2019m not investing because \u201cit has potential\u201d. I really want to love this phone but the product feels incomplete and rushed. And I don\u2019t have time to wait for them to fix these issues. What\u2019s the point of having amazing hardware if the software is sometimes unusable?",

                "review_text": "I've been using the PH-1 as my main phone for several months. Pros: * Minimal design * Good performance * Reasonable battery life * Very large storage capacity So-Sos: * Notch is sometimes intrusive, but Android seems to have plans to support it better. Cons: * Epic bad camera. Even after the updates, it is typically slow to focus, with tragically bad color rendering, and poor low light performance. I did not notice any benefits to the dual sensor design. It is definitely a price/performance contender based on the discounted price. It is NOT a flagship killer, though it is so close -- just fix the camera. Hopefully the next generation from Essential will bring the camera system up to or beyond the Galaxy/Pixel/iPhone level.",

                "review_text": "I've used this for about 24 hours now and want to get a review up quickly prior to the release date for those who are considering this. Here are the highlights. For reference, my current phone is a Samsung S7 edge on Verizon. Setup: piece of cake. Popped the sim card out of the S7e, popped it into the Essential, when through some setup steps on the phone, connected my Google accounts, and it was operational. It let me select which of my apps I wanted to re-download and installed them (could take all with one click, but I de-selected some that I don't use first). I used the Content Transfer app from Verizon (free in the Google Play store) to transfer message history, photos, videos, etc. I was up and running with everything I use without missing a beat. The only thing I didn't see an easy way to replicate was the icons and widgets I've selected for my desktop(s), so that's a bit of work to reposition everything the way I like it. Bonus: no required apps It was nice to deselect and not have to install some of the garbage apps that Samsung and/or Verizon required me to keep on my phone. Robustness: no case required The Essential feels rock solid. It's one of their key selling points (titanium case vs aluminum in other phones), and they have a section on drop tests and not needing a case on their website. While it's not my goal to test this point excessively, I already dropped it accidentally from about 4' onto a hard surface and it was unscratched. Assuming this holds up, and that it in fact doesn't need a case, this is a big win. It's funny how we look at phones in the store naked, admiring their size and design and weight, but then have to protect them in a bulky case. I'm looking forward to using this au naturel. Water resistance: downside The Essential makes no claim about water resistance so I assume it would drown. That's a downside vs. the S7e and other waterproof phones. I suppose the equalizer would be a waterproof case but that kills the prior point. If water resistance is a key issue for you then this would negate the benefits of robustness and size (below) Size: efficient design plus no case makes it nicely smaller (see photo) See the photo attached of the S7e and Essential. They have the same screen real estate but the essential cleverly gets rid of the entire top section (where the Samsung logo and camera are) making it more than 1/2\" shorter, which is a nice gain at no cost. The Essential cleverly embeds the camera into the screen itself with no real downside since that's where the icon bar sits anyway, so the camera is basically taking up the space of one top icon. When you then add to that the lack of a case (see above), I'd estimate that it's about 20% smaller in overall area and 30% smaller in total volume. That's about the difference for it to be comfortable vs. uncomfortable in my back pocket. Design: minimalist It's slick and elegant - shiny with curved corners, but nothing flashy, including no logos. Screen: very good, but slightly less bright. The screen quality and resolution are very good and seems equal to the S7. Benefit of Essential is that the edge isn't curved - it gets the same amount of screen in the same width and keeps it flat which I prefer. At their respective brightest settings, the S7 is brighter though, which maybe helpful in daylight outdoor situations. GPS (with Endomondo for running) Accurate, with just a little wobble, same as S7 Headphones - no jack I'd prefer a regular headphone jack, but the supplied adapter worked fine and my regular headphones worked with it without issue. Fingerprint sensor - well done for 1-handed operation The sensor is positioned on the back, which turns out to be a very comfortable spot for 1-handed operation. I programmed it to read the index finger of either hand. This again speaks to it not needing a case - if a case were used you couldn't access the reader. The S7 is a little more awkward for 1-hand with the reader at the bottom of the front. Camera The built-in camera is solid, quick, good quality. The coming 360 camera promises to be a very cool addition. I'm looking forward to trying that out. Phone itself Sound quality is fine (on par with S7) for both hearing and speaking Dock for charging - coming soon (I hope!) The biggest missing item out of the gate for me, that I love with my S7, is the wireless charging dock. I have one at my desk and one by my bed for the S7, I use the Seneo which is great. I just drop the phone onto the dock and it sits at a perfect 60 degree angle as an alarm clock while charging. It's a step back to go back to plugging this in. The Essential website indicates that this is coming, although from the photos the dock appears to be just lying flat. I assume a 3rd party will come out with something to address this. Overall: This is a great option based on size, robustness, and lack of extra stuff. Downside (for me) is water resistance and lack of a wireless charging dock at least initially. Otherwise it's as good or better than alternatives in other respects, and I'm very happy with it. Edit #1 - 9/6/17 As of now, visual voicemail is not set up for this device with Verizon. Agent said that it typical of new devices so it shouldn't be a lasting issue. Regular voicemail (dial in) works fine.",
